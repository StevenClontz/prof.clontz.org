## 4.2 Applications of Parametrizations

### 4.2.1 Parametric Formula for \\(dy/dx\\)

- Let \\(y\\) be a function of \\(x\\), and suppose its
  curve is parametrized by the equations \\(x(t),y(t)\\). Then by
  the Chain Rule, \\(\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}\\)
  at each point where all of these functions is differentiable.
- **Example**
  Find the line tangent to the curve parametrized by
  \\(x=\tan t,y=\sec t,-\frac{\pi}{2}<t<\frac{\pi}{2}\\)
  at the point \\((1,\sqrt 2)\\).
- **Example**
  Find the point on the parametric curve \\(x=\ln t,y=t+\frac{1}{t},t>0\\)
  which has a horizontal tangent line.

### 4.2.2 Arclength

- Suppose a curve \\(C\\) is defined parametrically by one-to-one functions
  \\(x(t),y(t)\\) on \\(a\leq t\leq b\\), where
  \\(\frac{dx}{dt},\frac{dy}{dt}\\) are continuous and never simultaneously
  zero. Then the length of \\(C\\) is defined to be
  \\(
    L
  =
    \int_{t=a}^{t=b}ds
  =
    \int_{t=a}^{t=b}\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}
  =
    \int_a^b\sqrt{(\frac{dx}{dt})^2+(\frac{dy}{dt})^2}\,dt
  \\).
- **Example** Use the arclength formula to find the length of the
  line segment joining \\((-2,3)\\) and \\((2,0)\\).

- **Example** Find the perimeter of the curve parametrized by
  \\(x=\sin^3 t,y=\cos^3 t,0\leq t\leq 2\pi\\).

### 4.2.3 Surface Areas from Revolution

- Suppose a smooth curve \\(C\\)
  is defined parametrically by one-to-one functions
  \\(x(t),y(t)\\) on \\(a\leq t\leq b\\), with \\(y(t)\geq 0\\).
  Then the area of the surface of revolution obtained by rotating
  \\(C\\) about the \\(x\\)-axis is given by
  \\(2\pi\int_{t=a}^{t=b}y(t)\,ds\\).

- **Example** Find the area of the surface of revolution obtained by
  rotating the portion of the parabola \\(y=x^2\\) from \\((0,0)\\)
  to \\((4,2)\\) around the \\(x\\)-axis.
