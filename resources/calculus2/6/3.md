## 6.3 Manipulating Power Series

### 6.3.1 Multiplication and Composition with Power Series

- Let \\(p(x)\\) be a polynomial. If \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\\)
  is a power series converging to \\(f(x)\\), then
  \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty p(x)c_n(x-a)^n\\) is a power series converging to
  \\(p(x)f(x)\\) with the same domain of convergence.
- **Example.** Find the Maclaurin series for \\(x^3\cos(x)\\).
- Let \\(p(x)\\) be a polynomial. If \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\\)
  is a power series converging to \\(f(x)\\), then
  \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(p(x)-a)^n\\) is a power series converging to
  \\(f(p(x))\\) with an appropriate domain of convergence.
- **Example.** Find the Maclaurin series for \\(\exp(x^2)\\).

### 6.3.2 Differentiating and Integrating Power Series

- If \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\\)
  is a power series converging to \\(f(x)\\) on an open interval, then
  \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n n(x-a)^{n-1}\\) is a power series converging to
  \\(f(x)\\) with the same domain of convergence.
- **Example.** Prove that \\(\frac{d}{dx}[e^x]=e^x\\).
- **Example.** Find the Maclaurin series for \\(-\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\).
- If \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n\\)
  is a power series converging to \\(f(x)\\) on an open interval, then
  \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n \frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\\)
  is a power series converging to
  \\(\int f(x)\,dx\\) with the same domain of convergence.
- **Example.** Find a power series converging to \\(\ln(x)\\) where \\(0<x<2\\).
