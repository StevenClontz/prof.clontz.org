## 3.2 Volumes by Cross-Sectioning

### 3.2.1 Defining Volume with Integrals

- The volume of a solid defined between \\(x=a\\) to \\(x=b\\)
  with a cross-sectional area of \\(A(x)\\) at each \\(x\\)-value
  is defined to be \\(V=\int_a^b A(x)\,dx\\).

- Steps for solving such problems:
    1. Sketch the solid along the \\(x\\)-axis with a typical
       cross-section at some \\(x\\) value.
    2. Find the formula for \\(A(x)\\), and the minimal/maximal
       \\(x\\) values \\(a,b\\).
    3. Evaluate \\(V=\int_a^b A(x)\,dx\\).
- **Example** Show that the volume of a pyramid with a square base
  of sidelength \\(2\\) and height \\(3\\) is \\(4\\) cubic units.

### 3.2.2 Circular Cross-Sections

- In the case that all cross-sections are circular, we may replace
  \\(A(x)\\) with \\(\pi[R(x)]^2\\), where \\(R(x)\\) is the radius
  of the circular cross-section at that \\(x\\) value.
- **Example** Prove that a cone of radius \\(r\\) and height \\(h\\)
  has volume \\(V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\\).

### Review Exercises

1.  Find the volume of a solid located between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=2\\)
    with cross-sectional area \\(A(x)=x^2+1\\) for all \\(-1\leq x\leq 2\\).
2.  Find the volume of a solid located between \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1\\)
    whose cross-sections are parallelograms with base length \\(b(x)=x+1\\)
    and height \\(h(x)=x^2+1\\) for all \\(0\leq x\leq 1\\).
4.  Find the volume of a wedge cut from a circular cylinder
    with radius \\(2\\), sliced out at a \\(45^\circ\\) angle from the
    diameter of its base. (Hint: Sketch the
    diameter of the cylinder along the \\(x\\)-axis from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\),
    and use the equation \\(x^2+y^2=2^2\\).
    The cross-sections will be isosceles triangles.)
5.  Prove that the volume of a sphere with radius \\(r\\) is
    \\(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\\). (Hint: Draw a diameter of the sphere
    on the \\(x\\)-axis from \\(-r\\) to \\(r\\), and use the equation
    \\(x^2+y^2=r^2\\).)
5.  Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region
    \\(0\leq y\leq 4-x^2\\) and whose
    cross-sections are
    equilateral triangles perpendicular to the \\(x\\)-axis.
