## 5.3 Series

### 5.3.1 Series as Partial Sum Sequences

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/docTkY5KEOI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- For a given sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\), its
  partial sum sequence \\(\\<s_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\) is defined explicitly
  by \\(s_n=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i=a_0+a_1+\dots+a_n\\), and defined recursively by
  \\(s_0=a_0\\) and \\(s_{n+1}=s_n+a_{n+1}\\).
- **Example** Write out the first few terms of the partial sum sequence for
  \\(\\<1,2,3,4,5,\dots\\>\\).
- **Example** Write out the first few terms of the partial sum sequence for
  \\(\\<b_i\\>\_{i=1}^\infty\\) where \\(b_i=\frac{6}{i}\\).
- The series \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n=a_0+a_1+a_2+\dots\\) represents the
  sum of the infinite sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\). If its
  partial sum sequence converges to \\(L\\), then we say that its series
  converges to \\(L\\) and the value of the series is \\(L\\)
  (written \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n=a_0+a_1+a_2+\dots=L\\)). Otherwise,
  we say the series diverges.

### 5.3.2 Telescoping/Geometric Sequences and Series

- A telescoping series is a series whose partial sum sequence allows for
  canceling.
- **Example** Show that \\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1})\\)
  converges to \\(1\\) by evaluating the limit of its partial sum sequence.
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{2}{n^2+3n+2}\\) converge or
  diverge?

- The geometric series defined for real numbers \\(a,r\\) is
  \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n=a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+\dots\\).
- The geometric series \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n\\) converges to
  \\(\frac{a}{1-r}\\) when \\(|r|<1\\), and diverges when \\(|r|\geq 1\\).
- **Example** Compute \\(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\dots\\).
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{2}{3^{k+1}}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{2}{(1/3)^{k+1}}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?

### 5.3.3 Divergent Series

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZreQ7WzkLs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The Series Divergence Test: If a sequence fails to converge to \\(0\\),
  then its series diverges.
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{k^2+3}{2k^2+k+5}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?
- This does NOT mean that if a sequence converges, then its series converges.
- The harmonic sequence \\(\\<\frac{1}{n}\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\) converges to
  \\(0\\), but its series \\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}\\) diverges.

### 5.3.4 Arithmetic Rules and Reindexing

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_3H1IEtz0I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Because a series is a limit, it follows the same rules as limits do.
- **Example** Evaluate the convergent series
  \\(\sum_{i=0}^\infty\frac{1+\frac{2^{i+2}}{i+1}-\frac{2^{i+2}}{i+2}}{2^i}\\).
- The starting index for a series may be adjusted by offsetting the index for
  its sequence in the opposite direction.
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{m=-1}^\infty\frac{1}{m+2}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?
