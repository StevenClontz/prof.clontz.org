## Calculus 2

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1. In addition to developing advanced techniques
for computing and applying integrals, the ultimate goal of the course is
to introduce the *power series*, an "infinite polynomial" which can be used
to express a wide class of differentiable functions. [[Link](/resources/calculus2/)]

## Calculus 3

My notes on chapters 12-16 of Stewart's Calculus text are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/StevenClontz/Stewart-12to16).
