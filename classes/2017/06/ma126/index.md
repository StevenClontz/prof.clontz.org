## Course Information

* Semester: Summer 2017
* Title: Calculus II
* Section:
    * MA 126-103
* Times:
    * Mon-Fri 8:40am-9:55am
* Room:
    * ILB 370
* Office Hours
    * Mon-Fri 8:10-8:40am


## Course Description

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1. In addition to developing advanced techniques
for computing and applying integrals, the ultimate goal of the course is
to introduce the *power series*, an "infinite polynomial" which can be used
to express a wide class of differentiable functions.

This course utilizes team-based learning.
Students will
complete a survey that will place them into appropriate Teams at the
start of the semester, and are expected to complete readiness activities
before coming to class.
Teams will work together throughout the semester to master course
standards, with the support of the instructor.


## Textbook and Resources

All material for this course is available at no cost at
[prof.clontz.org/resources/calculus-2][text]. Students are welcome to use
*University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)* or any other textbook
as a supplemental resource, but it is not required and no homework from
this text will be assigned.

It's not required, but many students benefit from bringing a smart device
to class that can access the course website.


## Standards

The main goal of this course is for students to **master** the
**Core and Supplemental Standards** for the course.
A list of these standards is available on the
[Standards page][standards].

To demonstrate mastery of these standards, students must first
earn **Attempt Points (AP)** by participating in class.


## Team Formation

**Teams** of 4-6 students will be formed based upon a survey
of students' academic interests and abilities. Each student completing
this survey will earn 15 Attempt Points.
Members of each Team will collaborate on quizzes and activities
throughout the semester.


## Participation

### Preparation for Class

The [class calendar][calendar] outlines the
sections of [online materials][text] that students will be
responsible for reviewing in preparation for class each week.

### Quizzes

On the first day of class each week, students will first be given an
**Individual Readiness Quiz (IRQ)** of multiple-choice
questions to check their understanding of the online materials.
Each correct response earns one Attempt Point to that
individual.

Immediately following the IRQ (before solutions are revealed),
each Team will come together to take an
identical **Team Readiness Quiz (TRQ)**, discussing each member's choices and
agreeing on a solution. These responses are immediately revealed as correct
or incorrect, and the Team will keep guessing until the correct answer is
found. After the quiz, 4 Attempt Points are banked to the Team (not
each individual) for each correct first guess, 2 AP for each correct
second guess, and 1 AP for each correct third guess.

### Activities

On days without quizzes, the instructor will assign **Activities**
to be completed as a Team during the first 60 minutes of class. These
activities will be used to cement students' understanding of the
course standards. 4 Attempt Points will be banked to Teams
(not individuals) that successfully complete each day's Activity(s).

### Surveys

Attempt Points banked after TRQs and Activities are distributed
to Team members based on
**Peer Evaluation Surveys (PES)** distributed online throughout the semester.
The instructor will interpret the results of these surveys and distribute
AP accordingly. Students who fail to complete a survey by its deadline will
forfeit their AP.



## Attempting Standards

Students may spend their Attempt Points to individually demonstrate mastery
of the Core and Supplemental Standards.

* During the last 15 minutes of most class days, students may attempt
  **In-Class Exercises** based on several of the most recently covered
  Standards.
  Each submitted In-Class Exercise costs 1AP. Students may choose to only submit
  some of the attempted exercises if they are not confident in their answers.
* During office hours, students may complete **Office Exercises** based on any
  Standard that is not past its deadline. If all active Standards have been
  completely mastered, then Standards past their deadline may be attempted
  instead. Each attempted Office Example
  costs 2AP, whether it is completed or not.
* During the Final Exam, students may attempt **Final Exercises** based on
  any of the Standards from the entire course. These final attempts do not cost
  any AP, but time is limited.

Each exercise is marked by the instructor as follows.

* **✓**: The response demonstrates complete understanding of the Standard.
* **★**: The response may indicate full understanding of the Standard,
  but clarification or minor corrections are required.
* **×**: The response does not demonstrate complete understanding of the
  Standard.

Students may improve **★** marks to **✓** marks as follows.

* For In-Class Exercises, appropriate revisions must be made and presented
  to the instructor within one week of the returned exercise. This does not
  cost any AP.
* For Office Exercises, **★** marks are not offered.
* For Final Exercises, **★** marks are automatically converted to **✓** marks
  at a cost of 10AP per each conversion.




## Grade Assignments

Grades are assigned based on students' mastery of the Core and Supplemental
Standards. This is calculated by adding up to **2** earned **✓** marks for each
of the sixteen Core Standards,
and up to **1** earned **✓** mark for each of the sixteen
Supplemental Standards, for a total of **48** possible **✓** marks.

* **A**:
    * At least **42/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
    * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **16/16** Core Standards.
* **B**:
    * At least **34/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
    * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **14/16** Core Standards.
* **C**:
    * At least **26/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
    * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **12/16** Core Standards.
* **D**:
    * At least **18/48** **✓** marks have been earned.





## Student Data

Student data will be stored on the instructor's office computer, and will
be available via printed progress reports distributed during class at
regular intervals.


## Academic Honesty

Any violations of academic honesty will be reported to the University
and will result in **automatic and immediate failure of the course**. Refer to
South's [Additional Academic Course Policies][usacoursepolicies] for
