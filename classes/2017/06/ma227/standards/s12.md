## S12: Divergence Theorem

- The Divergence Theorem states that if \\(\partial D\\) is the outward-oriented
  boundary of a solid \\(D\\), then
  \\(\iint_{\partial D}\vect{F}\cdot\vect{n}\,d\sigma=
  \iiint_D\dv\vect F\,dV\\).
    - An alternate form of Green's Theorem holds for boundaries \\(\partial R\\)
      of regions \\(R\\) in the plane:
      \\(\int_{\partial R}\vect{F}\cdot\vect{n}\,ds=
      \iint_R\dv\vect F\,dA\\).
- Note that our theorems all fit the form of a Generalized Fundamental Theorem
  of Calculus, studied in differential geometry/topology.
    - \\(\int_{I}f'(x)\,dx=[f]\_{\partial I}\\)
    - \\(\int_C\nabla f\cdot d\vect r=[f]\_{\partial C}\\)
    - \\(\iint_R\curl\vect{F}\cdot\veck\,dA=
      \int_{\partial R}\vect{F}\cdot\vect{T}\,ds\\)
    - \\(\iint_R\dv\vect{F}\,dA=
      \int_{\partial R}\vect{F}\cdot\vect{n}\,ds\\)
    - \\(\iint_S\curl\vect{F}\cdot\vect{n}\,d\sigma=
      \int_{\partial S}\vect{F}\cdot\vect{T}\,ds\\)
    - \\(\iiint_D\dv\vect{F}\,dV=
      \iint_{\partial D}\vect{F}\cdot\vect{n}\,d\sigma\\)
    - General form:
      \\(\underbrace{\int\cdots\iint_{\Omega}}\_{n+1}\, f'\,d\omega=
      \underbrace{\int\cdots\int_{\partial\Omega}}\_{n}\, f\,d\omega'\\)
