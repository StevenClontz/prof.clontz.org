## C03. Vector Calculus

- The limit of a vector function \\(\lim_{t\to t_0}\vect r(t)\\)
  is the vector approached by \\(\vect r(t)\\) for values of \\(t\\)
  near \\(t_0\\).
    - These limits may be computed component-wise:
      \\(
      \lim_{t\to t_0}\vect r(t) =
      \\<\lim_{t\to t_0} x(t),\lim_{t\to t_0} y(t),\lim_{t\to t_0} z(t)\\>
      \\).
    - A vector function is continuous whenever
      \\(\lim_{t\to t_0}\vect r(t) =\vect r(t_0)\\).
- The derivative of a vector function is given by
  \\[
  \frac{d\vect r}{dt}=\vect{r}'(t)=
  \lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{\vect r(t+\Delta t)-\vect r(t)}{t}
  \\]
    - The derivative \\(\vect{r}'(t)\\) describes tangent vectors to
      each point on the curve given by \\(\vect{r}(t)\\).
    - Since the derivative is a limit, it may be computed component-wise:
      \\(
      \vect r'(t) =
      \\<x'(t),y'(t),z'(t)\\>
      \\).
- The (indefinite) integral of a vector function \\(\int\vect{r}(t)\,dt\\)
  describes all antiderivatives \\(\vect{R}(t)+\vect{C}\\) such that
  \\(\frac{d}{dt}[\vect{R}(t)+\vect{C}]=\vect{r}(t)\\).
    - This may also be computed component-wise:
      \\(
      \int \vect r(t) \,dt =
      \\<\int x(t)\,dt,\int y(t)\,dt,\int z(t)\,dt\\>
      \\).
    - Integrals may be used to solve vector differential equations
      (aka initial value problems), finding \\(\vect{r}(t)\\)
      from \\(\vect{r}'(t)\\) and \\(\vect{r}(t_0)\\).
