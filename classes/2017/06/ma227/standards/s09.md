## S09: Surface Parametrization

- A surface parameterization maps parameters \\(u,v\\) to points/vectors
  \\(\vect r(u,v)\\) on a surface in 3D space.
    - Surfaces defined by \\(z=f(x,y)\\) may be parameterized by
      \\(\vect r(u,v)=\\<u,v,f(u,v)\\>\\).
    - The plane passing through \\(P_0\\) and
      parallel to the vectors \\(\vect w_1,\vect w_2\\) may be
      parameterized by \\(\vect r(u,v)=P_0+u\vect w_2+v\vect w_2\\).
    - Surfaces defined by cylindrical/spherical equations may be parameterized
      by substituting into the appropriate coordinate transformation.
      For instance, the cone \\(z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\) is equivalent to
      \\(z=r\\) in cylindrical and \\(\phi=\frac{\pi}{4}\\) in spherical,
      so \\(\vect r(r,\theta)=
      \vect c(r,\theta,r)=\\<r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,r\\>\\) and
      \\(\vect r(\rho,\theta)=\vect s(\rho,\pi/4,\theta)=
      \\<\rho\sin(\pi/4)\cos\theta,
      \rho\sin(\pi/4)\sin\theta,\rho\cos(\pi/4)\\>\\) are possible
      parameterizations.
