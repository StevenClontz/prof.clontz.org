## C02. Vector Functions and Curves

- A vector function maps parameters \\(t\\) to points/vectors
  \\(\vect r(t)\\) on a curve in 2D or 3D space.
    - Arbitrary vector functions may be sketched by the use of a
      chart of \\(t,x,y,z\\) values.
    - Vector functions may also be expressed as parametric equations
      defining each component \\(x(t),y(t),z(t)\\) in terms of \\(t\\).
- Lines and line segments are given by linear vector equations.
    - The line passing through a point \\(P_0\\) and parallel to the
      vector \\(\vect v\\) has equation \\(\vect r(t)=P_0+\vect v t\\).
    - The line segment beginning at \\(P_0\\) and ending at \\(P_1\\)
      has equation \\(\vect r(t)=P_0+(P_1-P_0)t\\) with the domain
      \\(0\leq t\leq 1\\).
- Curves defined by \\(y=f(x)\\) may be easily modeled by a vector function.
    - Let \\(\vect r(t)=\\<t,f(t)\\>\\) to parametrize the curve left-to-right.
    - Let \\(\vect r(t)=\\<-t,f(-t)\\>\\) to parametrize the curve
      right-to-left.
- Circles in the \\(xy\\) plane are modeled using sine and cosine.
    - The circle with radius \\(r\\) and center \\(P_0\\) may be parametrized
      counter-clockwise with \\(\vect r(t)=P_0+\\<r\cos t,r\sin t\\>\\).
    - The circle with radius \\(r\\) and center \\(P_0\\) may be parametrized
      clockwise with \\(\vect r(t)=P_0+\\<r\sin t,r\cos t\\>\\).
