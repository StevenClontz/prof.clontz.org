## C04. Arclength Parameter and the TNB Frame

- The arclength parameter \\(s(t)\\) is defined to be the directed arclength
  from \\(\vect r(0)\\) to \\(\vect r(t)\\).
    - The arclength of a curve from \\(t=a\\) to \\(t=b\\) is given by
      \\(L=\int_a^b\\|\vect{r}'(t)\\|\,dt\\).
    - Thus the arclength parameter is given by
      \\(s(t)=\int_0^t\\|\vect{r}'(\tau)\\|\,d\tau\\).
      Note that \\(\frac{ds}{dt}=\\|\vect{r}'(t)\\|\\).
    - Usually \\(s\\) is left in terms of \\(t\\) and used indirectly,
      but in special cases a curve
      may be parameterized directly in terms of \\(s\\).
- The arclength parameter is used to define the \\(TNB\\) frame for a
  curve: three mutually orthogonal unit vectors defined at each point of a curve
  independent from the curve's parameterization.
    - The unit tangent vector is given by
      \\(\vect T=\frac{d\vect r}{ds}=\frac{d\vect r/dt}{\\|d\vect r/dt\\|}\\).
      It gives the direction of motion.
    - The unit normal vector is given by
      \\(\vect N=\frac{d\vect T/ds}{\\|d\vect T/ds\\|}=
      \frac{d\vect T/dt}{\\|d\vect T/dt\\|}\\).
      It gives the direction of curvature.
        - The orthogonality of \\(\vect T,\vect N\\) follows from the fact that
          \\(\vect T\cdot\vect T=1\\), and therefore (by the product rule)
          \\(\vect T\cdot\frac{d\vect T}{dt}=0\\).
    - The unit binormal vector is given by
      \\(\vect B=\vect T\times\vect N\\). If \\(\vect T\\) points forward,
      and \\(\vect N\\) points leftward, then \\(\vect B\\) points upward.
- The rate measuring how a curve turns at a point with respect to its arclength
  is known as its curvature \\(\kappa\\).
    - It is computed as \\(\kappa=\\|\frac{d\vect T}{ds}\\|=
      \frac{\\|d\vect T/dt\\|}{\\|d\vect r/dt\\|}\\).
