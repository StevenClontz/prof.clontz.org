## C01. Surfaces in Three-Dimensional Space

- Simple planes parallel to coordinate axes are given by \\(x=a\\),
  \\(y=b\\), and \\(z=c\\).
- The dot product may be used to obtain equations for arbitrary planes.
    - The equation \\(\vect N\cdot(P-P_0)=0\\) describes the points \\(P\\)
      on the plane passing through the point \\(P_0\\) and normal to the
      vector \\(\vect N\\).
    - If \\(P=\\<x,y,z\\>\\), \\(P_0=\\<x_0,y_0,z_0\\>\\), and
      \\(\vect N=\\<A,B,C\\>\\), then this equation may be expressed as
      \\(A(x-x_0)+B(y-y_0)+C(z-z_0)=0\\) and simplifies to
      \\(Ax+By+Cz=D\\) for some value of \\(D\\).
- Quadric surfaces are another common example used in calculus.
    - These surfaces are obtained from quadratic equations (polynomials of
      degree \\(2\\)) of the variables \\(x,y,z\\).
    - The simplest example is that of the sphere
      \\(\\|P-P_0\\|=r\\) describing the points \\(P\\) that are distance
      \\(r\\) from the sphere's center \\(P_0\\).
    - If \\(P=\\<x,y,z\\>\\), \\(P_0=\\<x_0,y_0,z_0\\>\\), and
      \\(\vect N=\\<A,B,C\\>\\), then this equation may be expressed as
      \\((x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2=r^2\\).
- The surfaces given by equations of \\(x,y,z\\) may be sketched by considering
  traces of the surface in simple planes \\(x=a\\), \\(y=b\\), or \\(z=c\\).
