## S04: Kinematics and Ideal Projectile Motion

- If \\(\vect r(t)\\) represents the position of a particle at time \\(t\\),
  then \\(\vect v(t)=\vect r'(t)\\) is its velocity and
  \\(\vect a(t)=\vect r^{\prime\prime}(t)\\) is its acceleration.
- Assuming ideal projectile motion (the only force on a particle is gravity)
  in the plane,
  the position of a projectile fired with initial position \\(\vect {r_0}\\)
  and initial velocity \\(\vect{v_0}\\)
  after \\(t\\) units of time have elapsed is
  \\(\vect r(t)=\vect{r_0}+ \vect{v_0}t-\frac{1}{2}g\vecj t^2\\).
    - Expanding \\(\vect{r_0}=\\<x_0,y_0\\>\\) and
      \\(\vect{v_0}=\\<v_0\cos\alpha,v_0\sin\alpha\\>\\) where
      \\(\alpha\\) is the angle of initial launch and
      \\(v_0=\\|\vect{v_0}\\|\\), this may be written as
      \\(\vect r(t)=
      \\<x_0+(v_0\cos\alpha)t,y_0+(v_0\sin\alpha)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\>\\).
    - Formulas such as \\(y_{max}=\frac{(v_0\sin\alpha)^2}{2g}\\) for the
      total flight time of a projectile fired from the ground may be derived
      from the ideal projectile motion position function.
