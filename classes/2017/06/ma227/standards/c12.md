## C12. Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals

- Due to the Chain Rule
  \\(\frac{df}{dt}=\nabla f(\vect r(t))\cdot\frac{d\vect r}{dt}\\)
  and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
  \\(\int_a^b\frac{df}{dt}\,dt=[f]\_a^b=f(b)-f(a)\\), the line
  integral of a gradient field may be computed simply by reversing the
  gradient.
    - If \\(\vect F=\nabla f\\), then \\(f\\) is called a potential function,
      and \\(\vect F\\) is called a conservative field.
    - The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals states that
      \\(\int_C \nabla f\cdot d\vect{r}=[f]\_A^B=f(B)-f(A)\\) where
      \\(A,B\\) are the starting/ending points of the curve \\(C\\).
    - This theorem may be used to find \\(\int_C \vect F\cdot d\vect{r}\\)
      more quickly when \\(\vect F\\) is a conservative field
      (whenever a potential function \\(f\\) exists).
    - When \\(\vect F\\) is conservative and \\(C\\) is a closed loop
      (it begins and ends at the same point),
      then \\(\int_C\vect F\cdot d\vect{r}=0\\).
- The curl of a vector field may be used to determine if a field is
  conservative.
    - The vector field \\(\vect F\\) is conservative if and only if
      \\(\curl\vect F=\vect 0\\).
    - Thus \\(\int_C\vect F\cdot d\vect{r}=0\\) when \\(C\\) is a closed loop
      and \\(\curl\vect F=\vect 0\\).
