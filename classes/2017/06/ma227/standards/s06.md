At the end of the course, each student should be able to...

- **S06: Lineariz.**
  Compute the linearization of a two-variable real-valued function at a point
  and use it for approximation.

## S06: Linearization

- Differentiable functions \\(f(x,y)\\) may be approximated near a
  point \\(P_0\\) by the linearization \\(L(x,y)\\) defined by the
  tangent plane at that point.
    - Its equation is \\(L(x,y)=f(P_0)+f_x(P_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(P_0)(y-y_0)\\).
