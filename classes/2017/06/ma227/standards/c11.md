## C11. Line Integrals

- The net area of the ribbon traveling along the curve \\(C\\) with
  height given by \\(f(x,y,z)\\) at each point is given by the line integral
  \\(\int_C f\,ds\\).
    - By parametrizing \\(C\\) with \\(\vect r(t),a\leq t\leq b\\) and computing
      \\(\frac{ds}{dt}\\), this integral may be evaluated by
      \\(\int_a^b f(\vect r(t))\frac{ds}{dt}\,dt\\).
- The work done by the force vector field \\(\vect{F}\\) along the curve
  \\(C\\) is given by the line integral \\(\int_C\vect F \cdot\vect {T}\,ds\\)
  where \\(\vect T\\) is the vector field of unit tangent vectors at each
  point of \\(C\\).
    - This integral is often written as \\(\int_C\vect F\cdot d\vect{r}\\).
    - By parametrizing \\(C\\) with \\(\vect r(t),a\leq t\leq b\\) and computing
      \\(\frac{d\vect{r}}{dt}\\), this integral may be evaluated by
      \\(\int_a^b \vect F(\vect r(t))\cdot\frac{d\vect{r}}{dt}\,dt\\).
    - This integral is often expanded as
      \\(\int_C\\<M,N,P\\>\cdot\\<dx,dy,dz\\>=
      \int_C M\,dx + \int_C N\,dy + \int_C P\,dz\\) \\(=
      \int_a^b M\frac{dx}{dt}\,dt + \int_a^b N\frac{dy}{dt}\,dt +
      \int_a^b P\frac{dz}{dt}\,dt\\)
    - The flow of a vector field through a curve is also given by
      \\(\int_C\vect F\cdot\vect T\,ds\\).
- The flux of the planar vector field \\(\vect{F}\\) moving across
  the closed planar curve \\(C\\) is given by the line integral
  \\(\int_C\vect F \cdot\vect {n}\,ds\\) where \\(\vect{n}\\) is the vector
  field of outward normal unit vectors at each point of \\(C\\).
    - This integral may be evaluated as \\(\int_C M\,dy-\int_C N\,dx\\),
      assuming counter-clockwise motion on \\(C\\).
- The usual rules of additivity, constant multiples, and so on apply.
