## C09. Polar, Cylindrical, and Spherical Coordinates

- The polar coordinate transformation
  \\(\vect p(r,\theta)=\\<r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\\>\\) has Jacobian
  \\(\frac{\partial\vect p}{\partial\\<r,\theta\\>}=r\\).
    - Thus if the region \\(R\\) in the \\(xy\\) plane is described by
      polar coordinates \\(G\\), then
      \\(\iint_R f(x,y)\,dA=\iint_G f(\vect p(r,\theta))\|r\|\,dA\\).
    - Assuming \\(r\geq 0\\), and assuming \\(G\\) is described by the
      outside polar curve \\(r=g_2(\theta)\\), inside polar curve
      \\(r=g_1(\theta)\\), and angles \\(\alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta\\), then
      \\(\iint_R f(x,y)\,dA=\int_\alpha^\beta\int_{g_1(\theta)}^{g_2(\theta)}
      f(\vect p(r,\theta)) r\,dr\,d\theta\\).
