## C09. Polar, Cylindrical, and Spherical Coordinates

- The polar coordinate transformation
  \\(\vect p(r,\theta)=\\<r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta\\>\\) has Jacobian
  \\(\frac{\partial\vect p}{\partial\\<r,\theta\\>}=r\\).
    - Thus if the region \\(R\\) in the \\(xy\\) plane is described by
      polar coordinates \\(G\\), then
      \\(\iint_R f(x,y)\,dA=\iint_G f(\vect p(r,\theta))\|r\|\,dA\\).
    - Assuming \\(r\geq 0\\), and assuming the region is described by the
      outside polar curve \\(r=g_2(\theta)\\), inside polar curve
      \\(r=g_1(\theta)\\), and angles \\(\alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta\\), then
      \\(\iint_R f(x,y)\,dA=\int_\alpha^\beta\int_{g_1(\theta)}^{g_2(\theta)}
      f(\vect p(r,\theta)) r\,dr\,d\theta\\).
- The cylindrical coordinate transformation
  \\(\vect c(r,\theta,z)=\\<r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z\\>\\) has Jacobian
  \\(\frac{\partial\vect p}{\partial\\<r,\theta,z\\>}=r\\).
    - Since \\(z\\) is preserved by this transformation, this is equivalent
      to reinterpretting the shadow \\(R\\) in the \\(xy\\) plane with
      polar coordinates \\(G\\).
    - Assuming \\(r\geq 0\\), this yields
      \\(\iiint_D f(x,y,z)\,dV =
      \iint_R\int_{g_1(x,y)}^{g_2(x,y)}f(x,y,z)\,dz\,dA =
      \iint_G\int_{g_1(\vect p(r,\theta))}^{g_2(\vect p(r,\theta))}
      f(\vect c(r,\theta,z))r\,dz\,dr\,d\theta\\).
- The spherical coordinate transformation
  \\(\vect s(\rho,\phi,\theta)=\\<r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,\rho\cos\phi\\>\\)
  expands to \\(\vect s(\rho,\phi,\theta)=
  \\<\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta,\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta,\rho\cos\phi\\>\\)
  and has Jacobian
  \\(\frac{\partial\vect s}{\partial\\<\rho,\phi,\theta\\>}=\rho^2\sin\phi\\).
    - Thus if the solid \\(D\\) in \\(xyz\\) space is described by
      polar coordinates \\(H\\), then
      \\(\iiint_D f(x,y,z)\,dA=\iiint_H
      f(\vect s(\rho,\phi,\theta))\rho^2\|\sin\phi\|\,dA\\).
    - Assuming \\(0\leq\phi\leq\pi\\), and assuming the solid is described by
      the outside spherical surface \\(\rho=g_2(\phi,\theta)\\), inside
      spherical surface \\(\rho=g_1(\phi,\theta)\\), and is between the angles
      \\(\gamma\leq\phi\leq\delta\\) and \\(\alpha\leq\theta\leq\beta\\), then
      \\(\iiint_D f(x,y,z)\,dV=\int_\alpha^\beta\int_\gamma^\delta
      \int_{g_1(\phi,\theta)}^{g_2(\phi,\theta)}
      f(\vect s(\rho,\phi,\theta)) \rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\,d\phi\,d\theta\\).
