## S11: Green's Theorem and Stokes's Theorem

- Stokes's Theorem states that if the boundary \\(\partial S\\) of a
  surface \\(S\\) is oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the orientation
  of \\(S\\), then \\(\int_{\partial S}\vect F\cdot d\vect{r}=
  \iint_S\curl\vect F\cdot\vect{n}\,d\sigma\\).
    - This simplifies to Green's Theorem when \\(S\\) is the region
      \\(R\\) in the plane oriented by \\(\veck\\) with counter-clockwise
      boundary \\(C\\):
      \\(\int_C \vect F\cdot d\vect{r}=\iint_R \curl\vect F\cdot\veck\,dA =
      \iint_R(N_x-M_y)\,dA\\).
