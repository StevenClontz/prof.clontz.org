## S10: Surface Integrals

- The net volume of a solid with base given by the surface \\(S\\) and
  heights given by \\(f(x,y,z)\\) at each point is given by the
  surface integral \\(\iint_S f\,d\sigma\\).
    - When the surface is parametrized by \\(\vect r(u,v)\\) with domain
      \\(G\\) in the \\(uv\\) plane, this integral
      may be computed as
      \\(\iint_G f(\vect r(u,v))\\|\vect r_u\times\vect r_v\\|\,dA\\).
    - The orientation of \\(S\\) is irrelevant.
- The flux of the vector field \\(\vect F\\) passing through the surface
  \\(S\\) oriented by \\(\vect n\\) is given by
  \\(\iint_S \vect F\cdot\vect n\,d\sigma\\).
    - When \\(\vect r(u,v)\\) parametrizes \\(S\\) with the correct
      orientation, then this integral may be computed as
      \\(\iint_G \vect F(\vect r(u,v))\cdot(\vect r_u\times\vect r_v)\,dA\\).
    - When \\(\vect r(u,v)\\) parametrizes \\(-S\\) (with opposite
      orientation), then this integral may be computed as
      \\(-\iint_G \vect F(\vect r(u,v))\cdot(\vect r_u\times\vect r_v)\,dA\\).
