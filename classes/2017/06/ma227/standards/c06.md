vectors.

## C06. Chain Rule

- The single-variable Chain Rule \\(\frac{d}{dt}[f(u(x))]=f'(u(x))u'(x)\\)
  may be generalized for multiple variable functions.
    - If \\(f(P)\\) is a function of multiple variables and
      \\(\vect{r}(t)\\) is a vector function of equal dimension, then
      \\(\frac{d}{dt}[f(\vect r(t))]=\nabla f(\vect r(t))\cdot\vect r'(t)\\).
    - An immediate result is that \\(\nabla f(P_0)\\) is normal to the level
      curve of \\(f\\) passing through \\(P_0\\).
    - Thus \\(\\<f_x(P_0),f_y(P_0),-1\\>\\) is normal to the surface
      \\(z=f(x,y)\\) at \\(P_0\\), and
      \\(z=f(P_0)+f_x(P_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(P_0)(y-y_0)\\) is the tangent plane
      to the surface \\(z=f(x,y)\\) at \\(P_0\\).
- The total derivative \\(\frac{df}{dx}\\) describes the rate of change of
  \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) when the other variables of \\(f\\)
  are dependent on \\(x\\) as well.
    - The chain rule shows us
      \\(\frac{df}{dx}=\nabla f\cdot\frac{d\vect r}{dx}\\).
    - For three variables:
      \\(\frac{df}{dx}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dx}+
      \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{dz}{dx}\\).
    - Thus if \\(f(x,y)=c\\) defines \\(y\\) as a differentiable function of
      \\(x\\), then \\(\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{f_x}{f_y}\\).
