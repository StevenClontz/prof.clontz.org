## C06. Chain Rule

- The single-variable Chain Rule \\(\frac{d}{dt}[f(u(x))]=f'(u(x))u'(x)\\)
  may be generalized for multiple variable functions.
    - If \\(f(P)\\) is a function of multiple variables and
      \\(\vect{r}(t)\\) is a vector function of equal dimension, then
      \\(\frac{d}{dt}[f(\vect r(t))]=\nabla f(\vect r(t))\cdot\vect r'(t)\\).
    - An immediate result is that \\(\nabla f(P_0)\\) is normal to the level
      curve of \\(f\\) passing through \\(P_0\\).
    - Thus \\(\\<f_x(P_0),f_y(P_0),-1\\>\\) is normal to the surface
      \\(z=f(x,y)\\) at \\(P_0\\), and
      \\(z=f(P_0)+f_x(P_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(P_0)(y-y_0)\\) is the tangent plane
      to the surface \\(z=f(x,y)\\) at \\(P_0\\).
