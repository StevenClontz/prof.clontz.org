## C07. Triple Integrals

- The triple integral may be used to find the mass of an object with
  variable density.
    - Let \\(\iiint_D f(x,y,z)\,dV\\) be the mass \\(M\\) of the solid \\(D\\)
      with density given by \\(f(x,y,z)\\) at each point in \\(D\\).
    - At a fixed \\(x\\) value, the contribution of mass \\(\frac{dM}{dx}\\)
      of the cross-section \\(D[x]\\) is given by
      \\(\iint_{D[x]}f(x,y,z)\,dA\\).
    - Thus the triple integral may be evaluated by
      \\(\iiint_D f(x,y,z)\,dV=\int_a^b\frac{dM}{dx}\,dx=
      \int_a^b[\iint_{D[x]}f(x,y,z)\,dA]\,dx\\).
