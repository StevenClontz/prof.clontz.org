## S03. The Cross Product

- The right-hand rule (RHR) is a method of consistently producing an orthogonal
  direction two a pair of vectors \\(\vect v,\vect w\\).
    - If \\(\vect v\\) is a right-hand thumb, and \\(\vect w\\) is a
      right-hand index finger, then the RHR gives the direction of the
      right-hand middle finger when extended orthogonally to the thumb
      and index.
- The cross product \\(\vect v\times\vect w\\)
  measures the torque caused by a force
  given by \\(\vect v\\) on an arm given by \\(\vect w\\).
    - If the torque is orthogonal to the arm, then torque
      is simply given by the vector in the direction of the RHR (in the
      direction of "righty-tighty, lefty-loosy") with a magitnude given by
      scalar multiplication of the magnitudes of \\(\vect v,\vect w\\).
    - If the force is parallel to the arm, then no torque is caused.
    - It may be computed by
      \\(\vect v\times\vect w=(\\|\vect v\\|\\|\vect w\\|\sin\theta)\vect n\\)
      where \\(\theta\\) is the angle between the vectors and
      \\(\vect n\\) is the unit vector direction given by the RHR.
- The following properties may be proven about the cross product.
    - \\(\vect{v} \times \vect{w} = -(\vect{w} \times \vect{v})\\)
    - \\((c\vect{v})\times \vect{w} = \vect{v} \times (c\vect{w}) = c(\vect{v} \times \vect{w})\\)
    - \\(\vect{v} \times (\vect{w}_1 + \vect{w}_2) = \vect{v} \times \vect{w}_1 + \vect{v} \times \vect{w}_2\\)
    - \\(\vect{v} \times \vect{v} = \vect{0}\\)
    - \\(\vect{0} \times \vect{v} = \vect{0}\\)
    - \\(\veci\times\vecj=\veck\\), \\(\vecj\times\veck=\veci\\), and
      \\(\veck\times\veci=\vecj\\)
- These properties may be used to obtain a simplified formula:
  \\(\vect{v} \times \vect{w} = \\<v_yw_z-v_zw_y,v_zw_x-v_xw_z,v_xw_y-v_yw_x\\>\\).
    - This in turn may be simplified as a determinant:
      \\(\vect v\times\vect w = \detThree{\veci}{\vecj}{\veck}{v_x}{v_y}{v_z}{w_x}{w_y}{w_z}\\).
