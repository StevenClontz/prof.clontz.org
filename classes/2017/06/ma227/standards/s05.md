## S05: Multivariable Functions

- Functions of multiple variables
  are evaluated in the same way as single-variable functions.
    - Take  \\(f(x,y,z)=x^2yz-\frac{ze^x}{y^2+4}\\) for example.
    - Then \\(f(0,1,-3)=(0)^2(1)(-3)-\frac{(-3)e^{(0)}}{(1)^2+4}=-\frac{3}{5}\\).
    - The domain of a function is the set of allowable inputs for that
      function.
- Two-variable functions may be analyzed/sketched in 2D or 3D as follows.
    - The level curves of a two-variable function are the curves
      where \\(f(x,y)=k\\) for some value of \\(k\\). These curves lay in
      the domain and illustrate a topographical map of the function's values.
    - The graph of a two-variable function is the surface \\(z=f(x,y)\\).
      It may be sketched from the equation \\(z=f(x,y)\\) or by lifting
      the level curves to appropriate heights in \\(xyz\\) space.
