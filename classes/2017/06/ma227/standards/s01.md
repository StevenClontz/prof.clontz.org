## S01. Points and Vectors in 3D Space

- \\(xyz\\) space is modeled by extending a \\(z\\) axis perpendicular
  to the \\(xy\\) plane through the origin.
    - Points are given as ordered triples \\(P=\\<x,y,z\\>\\).
    - Distance/length in \\(xyz\\) space may be computed using the
      generalized Pythagorean Theorem: \\(x^2+y^2+z^2=d^2\\).
- A vector \\(\vect v\\) measures a direction and magnitude
  in 2D or 3D space.
    - Vectors are often represented by the point they point when starting
      from the origin: \\(\vect v=\\<v_x,v_y,v_z\\>\\).
    - Since the \\(xy\\) plane is contained in \\(xyz\\) space,
      we assume \\(\\<v_x,v_y\\>=\\<v_x,v_y,0\\>\\).
    - Vector addition describes the total direction and magnitude obtained
      by moving along the second vector after the first:
      \\(\vect v+\vect w=\\<v_x+w_x,v_y+w_y,v_z+w_z\\>\\).
    - Muliplication of a vector by a scalar (real number) gives the
      vector scaled by that real number:
      \\(c\vect v=\\<cv_x,cv_y,cv_z\\>\\).
    - The vector from point \\(P\\) to point \\(Q\\) is given by their
      subtraction: \\(Q-P=\\<q_x-p_x,q_y-p_y,q_z-p_z\\>\\).
    - The magnitude of a vector is given by its length:
      \\(\\|\vect v\\|=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}\\).
    - The direction of a vector is given by dividing out its length:
      \\(\frac{1}{\\|\vect v\\|}\vect v\\).
    - A unit vector has magnitude \\(1\\).
- The standard unit vectors point in the direction of the positive coordinate
  axes.
    - These are
      \\(\veci=\\<1,0,0\\>\\),
      \\(\vecj=\\<0,1,0\\>\\), and
      \\(\veck=\\<0,0,1\\>\\).
    - Vectors may be expressed as a linear
      combination of these: \\(\vect v=v_x\veci+v_y\vecj+v_z\veck\\).
- The zero vector is \\(\vect 0 =\\<0,0,0\\>\\).
