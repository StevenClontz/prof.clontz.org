## S07: Transformations of Variables

- A transformation of variables is a function \\(\\vect T(u,v)=\\<x,y\\>\\)
  that converts vectors \\(\\<u,v\\>\\) in the \\(uv\\) plane into vectors
  \\(\\<x,y\\>\\) in the \\(xy\\) plane.
    - A transformation is called affine if it preserves parallelograms.
    - All affine transformations are of the form
      \\(\\vect T(u,v)=\\<a_1u+b_1v+c_1,a_2u+b_2v+c_2\\>\\).
    - To find a transformation from the unit square in the \\(uv\\) plane
      to a parallelogram,
      the values of \\(a,b,c\\) may be calculated by setting each of
      \\(\vect T(0,0),\vect T(1,0), \vect T(1,1), \vect T(0,1)\\) to each
      of its corners.
    - To find a transformation from the unit triangle in the \\(uv\\) plane
      to a parallelogram,
      the values of \\(a,b,c\\) may be calculated by setting each of
      \\(\vect T(0,0),\vect T(1,0), \vect T(1,1)\\) to each
      of its corners.
- Affine transformations scale
  areas by a factor of \\(\detTwo{a_1}{b_1}{a_2}{b_2}\\)
  (where this value is
  negative when the transformation reflects orientation). This generalizes to
  the Jacobian \\(\frac{\partial\vect T}{\partial\\<u,v\\>}=\detTwo
  {\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}}{\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}}
  {\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}}{\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}}\\) for
  more arbitrary transformations.
    - It follows that if the transformation \\(\vect T(u,v)\\) transforms
      the region \\(G\\) in the \\(uv\\) plane into the region \\(R\\)
      in the \\(xy\\) plane, then
      \\(\iint_R f(x,y)\,dA=\iint_G
      f(\vect T(u,v))\|\frac{\partial\vect T}{\partial\\<u,v\\>}\|\,dA\\).
- Similarly for 3D transformations \\(\\vect T(u,v,w)=\\<x,y,z\\>\\) sending
  \\(H\\) to \\(D\\), it may be shown that
  \\(\iiint_D f(x,y,z)\,dV=\iiint_H
  f(\vect T(u,v,w))\|\frac{\partial\vect T}{\partial\\<u,v,w\\>}\|\,dV\\)
  where  \\(\frac{\partial\vect T}{\partial\\<u,v,w\\>}=\detThree
  {\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}}{\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}}
  {\frac{\partial x}{\partial w}}
  {\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}}{\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}}
  {\frac{\partial y}{\partial w}}
  {\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}}{\frac{\partial z}{\partial v}}
  {\frac{\partial z}{\partial w}}\\).
