## Course Description

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1. In addition to developing advanced techniques
for computing and applying integrals, the ultimate goal of the course is
to introduce the *power series*, an "infinite polynomial" which can be used
to express a wide class of differentiable functions.

This course uses elements of a flipped classroom and team-based learning.
Students will
complete a survey that will place them into appropriate Teams at the
start of the semester, and watch online lectures to introduce the material.
Teams will work together throughout the semester to master this
material, with the support of the instructor.


## Textbook and Resources

All material for this course is available at no cost at
[prof.clontz.org/resources/calculus-2][text]. Students are welcome to use
*University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)* or any other textbook
as a supplemental resource, but it is not required and no homework from
this text will be assigned.

Classwork will be shown on a projector, but students may wish to print
the classwork from the website to bring to class, or bring a
phone/tablet/laptop to pull up materials during class.


## Team Formation

Teams of 5-6 students will be formed using based upon an online survey.
These Teams will collaborate throughout the semester, working together to
master the course material. Failure by a student
to complete this survey will result
in a deduction in that student's Participation Grade.


## Participation

The [class calendar][calendar] outlines the
sections of [online lectures][text] that students will be responsible for
viewing in preparation for class. Participation in this preparation and
in class will be assessed through three mechanisms.

Students will be given an **Individual Readiness Quiz** of multiple-choice
questions to check their understanding
of the online lectures. Responses to these IRQs are accumulated at the end of
the semester, with correct responses worth 4 points, and all other responses
worth 2 points.

Immediately following the IRQ (before solutions are revealed),
each Team will come together to take an
identical **Team Readiness Quiz**, discussing each member's choices and
agreeing on a solution. These responses are immediately revealed as correct
or incorrect, and the Team will keep guessing until the correct answer is
found. Responses to these TRQs are accumulated at the end of the semester,
scoring 4 points for each correct first guess, 2 points for each correct
second guess, and 1 point for each correct third guess. All Team members
will share the same TRQ grade.

Following the TRQ, Teams will collaborate on review exercises for
additional practice. The instructor will be available to answer questions
and provide guidance during this time.

Occasionally during the semester, students will be asked to complete a
**Peer Evaulation Survey** to assess the participation of their Teammates.
The results of the final PES (given during the last two weeks of class)
will be used by the instructor to assign a grade
between 50% and 100%, where 50% represents consistently poor peer reviews,
85% represents average peer reviews, and 100% represents consistently excellent
peer reviews. Failure by a student
to complete a PES will result in a deduction in that
student's Participation Grade.

Each student's **Participation Grade** is the average of their percentage of IRQ
points earned, their Team's percentage of TRQ points earned, and their grade
earned from the PES.


## Standards

The main goal of this course is for students to master the
**Core Standards** for this course.
Students should also attempt to master as many of the
**Supplemental Standards** for this course as possible. A list of
these standards is available on the
[Standards page][standards].

A student may demonstrate **mastery** of a Core or Supplemental Standard
either during a **Standard Assessment** or in office hours.

* Standard Assessments will be given to students throughout the semester,
  as scheduled on the course [calendar][calendar]. Students will complete
  these assessments individually.
  Each question is based on Core or Supplemental Standard. Each response
  will be assigned one of the following marks:
    * **✓**: The response is demonstrates complete understanding of the Standard.
    * **\***: The response may indicate full understanding of the Standard,
      but clarification or minor corrections are required.
    * **×**: The response does not demonstrate complete understanding of the
      Standard.
    * **?**: The student was absent.
* Students may replace a **\*** mark with a **✓** mark by making the appropriate
  clarifications or corrections and showing the revised problem to the
  instructor during office hours. This must be done within one week
  of the return of the marked Assessment.
* Students may attempt to replace a **\*** or **×** mark with a
  **✓** mark by working a similar problem chosen by the instructor during office
  hours on a whiteboard. This must be done within four weeks of the return of
  the marked Assessment. Students are limited to a total of three such attempts
  per week (for all Standards, not each). The instructor may require
  appointments for such attempts to be made in advance or may require an
  attempt be rescheduled.
* Students may attempt to replace a **?** mark with a **✓** mark as described
  above for a **×** mark, but only if
  the instructor is provided acceptable documentation excusing the absence.

A Core Standard is considered **Partially Mastered** by a student who has
received **one ✓** mark, and **Mastered** by a student who has received
**two ✓** marks.
Each Core Standard will appear three times on the written
Standard Assessments.

A Supplemental Standard is considered **Mastered** by a
student who has received **one ✓** mark.
Each Supplemental Standard will appear two times on the written Standard
Assessments.

Students who have Mastered 13/16 of the Core and Supplemental Standards
will be given the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the remaining three
Core Standards in office hours, include those standards that haven't appeared
yet on a Standard Assessment.

All marks are considered final as of the last scheduled day of classes for
the semester, with one exception. A **Final Standard Assessment** will be given
during the university's scheduled Final Exam period for the course.
Only **✓** and **×** marks will be given on this final assessment, and these
marks are final.




## Grade Assignments

Grades in this course are determined based on participation
and mastery of the Core and Supplemental Standards as follows.
All criteria must be met by a student to receive each grade.

* **A**:
    * 16/16 of Core Standards are Partially Mastered or Mastered
    * At least 13/16 of Core Standards are Mastered
    * At least 13/16 of Supplemental Standards are Mastered
    * Participation Grade is at least 80%
* **B**:
    * At least 14/16 of Core Standards are Partially Mastered or Mastered
    * At least 10/16 of Core Standards are Mastered
    * At least 10/16 of Supplemental Standards are Mastered
    * Participation Grade is at least 70%
* **C**:
    * At least 12/16 of Core Standards are Partially Mastered or Mastered
    * At least 8/16 of Core Standards are Mastered
    * At least 8/16 of Supplemental Standards are Mastered
    * Participation Grade is at least 60%
* **D**:
    * At least 10/16 of Core Standards are Partially Mastered or Mastered


## Student Data

Student data will be stored on the instructor's Google Drive provided by
