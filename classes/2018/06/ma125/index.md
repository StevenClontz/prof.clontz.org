## Course Content

From the 
[Bulletin](http://www.southalabama.edu/bulletin/current/courses/mathematics/index.html):
*This course provides an introduction to calculus with
emphasis on differential calculus. Topics include limits of functions, derivatives of
algebraic and transcendental functions, application of the derivative to curve
sketching, optimization problems, and examples in the natural sciences,
engineering, and economics. The course concludes with an introduction to 
anti-derivatives, definite integrals, and the fundamental theorem of calculus.*

Basically, we will learn how inspect the behavior of mathematical functions
as their inputs **approach** or **limit** to certain values. Important
examples of limits include **derivatives** that measure instantaneous
rates of change, and **integrals** that measure areas under curves.

## Textbook and MyLab Math

The textbook for this course is
*Joel Hass and Maurice D. Weir: University Calculus â€“ Early Transcendentals*, 
(with access code to MyLab Math) Pearson, 3rd edition, 2016.
In particular, the physical textbook will not be required, 
but **an access code for MyLab Math is required**. Temporary access for
14 days may used until an access code is purchased.

The Math Technology Lab will be available for students to use during
the semester. Calculators will be provided by the lab for use during
assessments.

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined primarily based upon your mastery of the
course material. Throughout the semester, students will complete a
**Study Plan** in MyLab Math that reflects their learning of the material,
worth **85%** of their grade. The remaining **15%** will be based upon the 
**Final Exam**. Letter grades will be assigned on the usual 10-point scale.

In summary:

* Weight of assessments
    * **Study Plan: 85%**
    * **Final Exam: 15%**
* Letter grade assignments
    * **A: 90%** or greater
    * **B: 80%** or greater
    * **C: 70%** or greater
    * **D: 60%** or greater

## Active/Inactive Students

By default all students are considered **Active** in the course. However,
students that fail to sufficiently participate in the course 
(as described below) will be designated as **Inactive**. Inactive students
will be blocked from making progress on their Study Plan until
they return to Active status.

Students may be returned
to Active status by making an appointment and meeting with the instructor
and discuss the issues that caused the student to fall into Inactive status,
and come to an agreement on how to correct these issues.
Reinstatement of Active status is at the discretion of the instructor.

## Class Activities

On a typical day of class,
students will be seated at a table with a computer station and whiteboard.
The instructor will lecture on the material as briefly as possible,
and the remaining time in the
class will be spent by students working example problems in small groups
at their whiteboards.

Students that are tardy will be counted as absent.
Students that do not participate in working examples
on the whiteboard when asked to do so in small groups
will be counted as absent.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken Monday through Thursday.
Generally, only absences that have been previously approved by the
instructor or that are related to a medical issue (with accompanying
documentation from a medical professional) will be considered excused.


Students that accumulate five or more unexcused absences will become
Inactive.
Students are responsible for maintaining records of excused absences
and submitting those records to the instructor once four 
absences have been accumulated.

## MyLab Math Study Plan and Quizzes

In MyLab Math, each student will complete an individualized Study Plan
that reflects their progress through the course material. Each section
of the textbook covered in class is associated with up to five (usually four)
Objectives, each worth one Mastery Point. Each Objective may be practiced by
using the Practice button in the Study Plan.

Each section is also associated with a Quiz (available under Assignments).
Quizzes may only be taken in the Math Technology Lab in ASC 1301
during their operating hours.
Each Quiz includes one exercise for each Objective. Exercises that are completed
correctly will mark the corresponding Objective as mastered; incorrect
solutions will mark the corresponding Objective as unmastered.
Quizzes may be retaken as often as desired to retry unmastered Objectives,
but be warned that mastered Objectives may be taken away if answered incorrectly.

Each mastered Objective is worth one Mastery Point in the Study Plan. 
The Study Plan is worth the percentage of Mastery Points earned out of the maximum possible.

Inactive students will be locked out from working on MyLab Math quizzes until
they return to Active status.

The last day to work on quizzes to improve the Study Plan is the last day of classes:
Monday, July 23.

## Review Days

Fridays are set aside as review days. On review days, students have the option
to either come to class and review old material with the instructor, or to
work on MyLab Math quizzes in the Math Technology Lab. Attendance is not taken
on review days.

## Makeup Assignments

Quizzes may be retaken at any time during the Math Technology Lab's hours
of operation, so no makeup assignments will be necessary.

## Final Exam

A comprehensive Final Exam will be given at the end of the course.
Information on this exam will be given during the final weeks of classes.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating before the Final Exam will immediately lose all earned progress
in the Study Plan. Any student caught cheating during the Final Exam
will receive a 0 for the final and be deducted one letter grade
for the course. In addition,
the incident will be reported to the university.

Any student who is caught cheating twice will automatically receive
an F letter grade for the course.
