## Course Information

* Semester: 2018 Fall 
* Title: Topology 
* Sections:
    * TODO
* Office Hours (MSPB 314)
    * TODO



## Course Content

Generally, students will be encouraged to investigate the aspects of topology
they find interesting. To this end, students will be provided a
[Theorem Sequence] outlining several results from the field. 

In particular, the following topics (as designated by the department for this
course) are included:
- topological spaces, 
- surfaces,
- continuity, 
- homeomorphisms,
- compactness, 
- connectedness, 
- metric spaces, 
- product spaces, and 
- quotient spaces.

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon satisfactory completion
of four grade specifications:

- Presentations (in-class)
- Notes (in-class and at home)
- Knowledge (on quizzes)
- Proofs (on quizzes and at home)

Letter grades are assigned at the end of the semester as follows:

- A: All specifications satisfied
- B: 3/4 specifications satisfied
- C: 2/4 specifications satisfied
- D: 1/4 specifications satisfied
- F: No specifications satisfied

## Textbook and Resources

No textbook is required for this course; in fact, using a text is discouraged
except in extreme circumstances. Students will be provided a Theorem Sequence
that outlines all the content that may be covered in the course, and students
will be tasked with presenting original proofs for these facts.

### Theorem Sequence

TODO

## Teams

Teams will be organized by the instructor
near the beginning of the semester. Most
class activities will be done within teams, allowing students to learn
in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

## Assessing Understanding

In this class, the following marks will be used when assessing understanding:

* **✓** ("checkmark" or "mastery" mark):
  Represents complete understanding
* **✱** ("star" or "revision" mark):
  Represents near-complete understanding, but revisions for clarity or accuracy are required.
* **⚠** ("caution" or "issues" mark):
  Represents partial understanding, but further study is needed.
* **✘** ("X" mark):
  Represents negligible understanding.

## Consensus

Students are given the responsibility and privilege to help
make many choices during the course
that affect content coverage and grade assignments.
In the (hopefully rare) case that consensus cannot be reached in a team/class
decision, the instructor will make the final decision.

## Presentations

The majority of in-class time will be spent on presentations. Teams are responsible
for desiding which sections they wish to focus on, and divvying up theorems amongst
each other. During class, students will take turns presenting proofs of these theorems.

After each presentation, the team will agree upon which mark accurately reflects
the understanding demonstrated by the presentation. If a mark other than **✓**
is decided, that student has the option to make corrections and reattempt the presentation
at a later date. The team may choose to award multiple **✓** in the case of
an exceptional solution.

### Satisfying the Presentation Specification

At midsemester, the class will decide on a positive integer. All students who
earn at least this number of **✓** marks from presentations will have satisfied the
Presentation Specification.

## Notes

All students are expected to keep a \\(\LaTeX\\) notebook containing proofs of
all theorems presented within their teams. The easiest way to do this is by using
[Overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com). 

### Satisfying the Notes Specification

About three-quarters through the semester, the instructor will secretly choose three 
theorems that have been satisfactorally presented in each team. Students will
submit their full notebook, and the instructor will mark the proofs of these theorems.

Students who receive **✓** on all three theorems will have satisfied the Notes
Specification. Students who receive only **✓** and **✱** marks may revise their 
proofs and resubmit to satisfy the specification. Otherwise, an additional opportunity
to satisfy this specification will be given at the end of the semester,
with three newly chosen theorems. Only 2/3 **✓** will be required, but there will
be no opportunity for revisions.

## Knowledge 

Periodically multiple-choice closed-note Knowledge Quizzes will be given during class
to assess coverage of the nine topics outlined under Course Content. The class will
choose which topics will be covered on each quiz. Five questions from each
topic will be asked.

Students that answer at most one question incorrectly for a topic will be given
a **✓** mark for that topic. Only one **✓** may be earned per topic.
If two or more questions are answered incorrectly, then that topic may be
reattempted on a future quiz.

## Satisfying the Knowledge Specification

Students that earn 7/9 **✓** in this way will have satisfied the Knowledge 
Specification.

## Proofs

Periodically full-response Proofs Quizzes will be given during class to assess
student ability to discover and write proofs, including constructing
examples and counterexamples. Students will be given one or more theorems related
to (but not identical to) the theorems satisfactorally presented in class,
and will be allowed to submit proofs for each. These will be marked for
understanding by the instructor. Proofs marked as **✱** or **✓**
should be corrected (if needed) and typeset in \\(\LaTeX\\) to be
resubmitted and remarked.

### Satisfying the Proofs Specification

At midsemester, the class will decide on a positive integer. Students
who earn at least that many **✓** on \\(\LaTeX\\) typeset proofs
will have satisfied the Proofs Specification.

## Final Exam

The Final Exam will be a combination of a Knowledge Quiz and Proof Quiz,
which can be used to help students complete the Knowledge and Proof
Specifications.

## Makeup Policy

Due to the nature of assessment in this course, quiz makeups are not needed
and won't be offered since that credit may be made up on future quizzes.
However, additional time may be given on the Final Exam by request 
to students who have one or more excusable absences. Also, in exceptionl
cases the requirements to meet the Presentations Specification will be
lowered due to multiple excusable absences.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **✓**, either for
the relevant specification or the whole semester as appropriate. In addition,
the incident will be reported to the university.

In particular, cheating includes copy-pasting and blind rewriting of
results from other students, books, or the internet and submitting
these results as original work (i.e. plagarism). \\(\LaTeX\\) source files
may be required to assist with automatic detection of plagarized work.
