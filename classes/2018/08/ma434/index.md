## Course Information

* Semester: 2018 Fall 
* Title: Topology 
* Sections:
    * TODO
* Office Hours (MSPB 314)
    * TODO



## Course Content

Generally, students will be encouraged to investigate the aspects of topology
they find interesting. To this end, students will be provided a
[Theorem Sequence] outlining several results from the field. 

In particular, the following topics (as designated by the department for this
course) are included:
- topological spaces, 
- surfaces,
- continuity, 
- homeomorphisms,
- compactness, 
- connectedness, 
- metric spaces, 
- product spaces, and 
- quotient spaces.

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon satisfactory completion
of four grade specifications:

- Presentations (in-class)
- Notes (in-class and at home)
- Recollection (on quizzes)
- Proofs (on quizzes and at home)

Letter grades are assigned at the end of the semester as follows:

- A: All specifications satisfied
- B: 3/4 specifications satisfied
- C: 2/4 specifications satisfied
- D: 1/4 specifications satisfied
- F: No specifications satisfied

## Textbook and Resources

No textbook is required for this course; actually, using a text is discouraged
except in extreme circumstances. Students will be provided a Theorem Sequence
that outlines all the content that may be covered in the course, and students
will be tasked with presenting original proofs for these facts.

### Theorem Sequence

TODO

## Teams

Teams will be organized near the beginning of the semester. Most
class activities will be done within teams, allowing students to learn
in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

## Assessing Understanding

In this class, the following marks will be used when assessing understanding:

* **✓** ("checkmark" or "mastery" mark):
  Represents complete understanding
* **✱** ("star" or "revision" mark):
  Represents near-complete understanding, but revisions for clarity or accuracy are required.
* **⚠** ("caution" or "issues" mark):
  Represents partial understanding, but further study is needed.
* **✘** ("X" mark):
  Represents negligible understanding.

## Consensus

Students are given the responsibility and privilege to make many choices during the course
that affect content coverage and grade assignment.
In the (hopefully rare) case that consensus cannot be (honestly) reached in a team/class
decision, the instructor will make the final decision.

## Presentations

The majority of in-class time will be spent on presentations. Teams are responsible
for desiding which sections they wish to focus on, and divvying up theorems amongst
each other. During class, students will take turns presenting proofs of these theorems.

After each presentation, the team will agree upon which mark accurately reflects
the understanding demonstrated by the presentation. If a mark other than **✓**
is decided, that student has the option to make corrections and reattempt the presentation
at a later date.

### Satisfying the Presentation Specification

At midsemester, the class will decide on a positive integer. All students who
earn at least this number of **✓** marks from presentations will have satisfied the
Presentation Specification.

## Notes

All students are expected to keep a \\(\LaTeX\\) notebook containing proofs of
all theorems presented within their teams. The easiest way to do this is by using
[Overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com). 

### Satisfying the Notes Specification

About three-quarters through the semester, the instructor will secretly choose three 
theorems that have been satisfactorally presented in each team. Students will
submit their full notebook, and the instructor will mark the proofs of these theorems.

Students who receive **✓** on all three theorems will have satisfied the Notes
Specification. Students who receive **✱** marks may revise their proofs and
resubmit to satisfy the specification. Otherwise, an additional opportunity
to satisfy this specification will be given at the end of the semester,
with three newly chosen theorems, but no opportunity for revisions.

## Recollection

Periodically multiple-choice Recollection Quizzes will be given during class
to assess coverage of the nine topics outlined under Course Content. The class will
choose which topics will be covered on each quiz. Five questions from each
topic will be asked.

Students that answer at most one question incorrectly for a topic will be given
a **✓** mark for that topic. Only one **✓** may be earned per topic.

## Satisfying the Recollection Specification

Students that earn 8/9 **✓** in this way will have satisfied the Recollection
Specification.

## Proofs

Periodically full-response Proof Quizzes will be given during class to assess
student ability to discover and write proofs, including constructing
examples and counterexamples. Students will be given several theorems,
and will be allowed to submit proofs for each. These will be marked for
understanding by the instructor. Proofs marked as **✱** or **✓**
should be corrected (if needed) and typeset in \\(\LaTeX\\) to be
resubmitted and remarked.

### Satisfying the Proofs Specification

At midsemester, the class will decide on a positive integer. Students
who earn at least that many **✓** on \\(\LaTeX\\) typeset proofs
will have satisfied the Proofs Specification.

## Final Exam


## Makeup Policy



## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **✓**, either for
the relevant standard(s) or the whole semester as appropriate. In addition,
the incident will be reported to the university, and the student may be
required to take future assessments during office hours.

## USAOnline and USA Course Policies
