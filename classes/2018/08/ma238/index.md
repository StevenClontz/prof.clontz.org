* Title: Differential Equations
* Section: MA 238-104
  * Tue/Thu 12:30-1:45pm
  * MSPB 360
* Office Hours
  * MW 1:15-2:45pm and TR 1:45-3:15pm
  * MSPB 314

## Course Content

The course is split into five **Modules**, each of which is split into
several **Standards** of learning. These are listed on the course
[Standards][standards] PDF.

In particular, our course standards are aligned with the following
learning outcomes defined by the Association of American Colleges & Universities:

- Convert relevant information into various mathematical forms (e.g., equations, graphs,
diagrams, tables, words).
- Solve mathematical problems

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined purely based upon your mastery of the
twenty-four Course Standards. Each time you successfully demonstrate
mastery of a Standard by correctly solving a relevant exercise, you will
earn a **Mastery Mark ✓**. Up to two **✓** per Standard will be awarded,
plus an additional **3✓** for completing **Advanced Modeling (AM)** tasks,
for a total of **51✓**.

Letter grades are assigned based on how much content was learned
by each student, measured by how many **✓** were earned.

* **A**: **48✓**, including **3✓** from AM
* **B**: **42✓**, including **1✓** from AM
* **C**: **36✓**
* **D**: **30✓**

## Textbook and Resources

Much of the material for this course will be provided on this website.

Homework will be assigned from [MyLabsPlus][mlp], which will be required as
described below. The physical textbook will not be required for this course,
but may be used by students for additional reference/practice.

The use of any calculator is allowed, as long as it does not support communication
functionality or internet connectivity.

## Teams

**Teams** will be organized near the beginning of the semester. All
class activities will be done within teams, allowing students to master the
course standards in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

## Active/Inactive Students

By default all students are considered **Active** in the course. However,
students that fail to sufficiently participate in the course 
(as described below) will be designated as **Inactive**. Inactive students
lose certain privileges (as described below).

Students may be returned
to Active status by making an appointment and meeting with the instructor
and discuss the issues that caused the student to fall into Inactive status.
Reinstatement of Active status is at the discretion of the instructor.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken daily.
Generally, only absences that have been previously approved by the
instructor or that are related to a medical issue (with accompanying
documentation from a medical professional) will be considered excused.
All excused absences must be documented via email with the instructor.

Students that accumulate two unexcused absences within a three-week period
will become Inactive.

## Class Activities

On a typical day of class,
each team will be seated at a table with a computer station and whiteboard.
The instructor will provide slides that may be viewed at each station.
Students will work through the material covered on these slides within their
teams, with the support of the instructor as needed.

Slides describing **Activities** should be completed by each team on the
provided whiteboard. All details must be shown on the whiteboard, 
and the Activity's number should also
be marked. 

Each completed activity must be photographed and uploaded to 
Google Drive team folder provided by the instructor, to serve as notes for that
team (including students that were absent that day). **Students are not
allowed to take personal notes during class time; you must collaborate on your
team's whiteboard notes during class.**

Students that attend class but refuse to participate in completing Activities
on the whiteboard or refuse to document work in Google Drive will 
become Inactive.

## Readiness Assurance

Before each module of the course, students are given a 
[list of materials](readiness)
for review. Readiness for that module will be assessed on a **Readiness
Assurance Test**, first individually (iRAT), and then as a team (tRAT).
High scores reflect sufficient preparedness for the module, while low
scores demonstrate a need for further review.

Students that earn below a 70% average on an iRAT and tRAT will
become Inactive.

## Peer Evaluation Survey

Students will be asked to complete a Peer Evaluation Survey occasionally
during the semester to evaluate their teammates. Students that fail to complete
the survey or who receive negative feedback from multiple students
will become Inactive.

## MyLabsPlus

Online homework will be assigned on [MyLabsPlus][mlp] throughout the semester, 
associated with many (not all) of the course standards as they are covered
in class.

Students that fall below 70% progress on the online homework are considered 
Inactive, but will automatically return to Active status by improving this
score to 70% or better.

## Mastery Quizzes

During most class days,
Active students will be able to complete a short **Mastery Quiz**.
Each standard covered in class will appear on up to four Mastery Quizzes,
at most once a week.
A schedule of which standards are covered on each quiz is available on
the [Calendar][calendar].

In addition, Active students will
be offered two 75-minute **Comprehensive Mastery Quizzes**
that include exercises for every standard covered
in the class so far.

All submissions are due by the end of the class period.
Inactive students will not receive any credit for these quizzes unless
they have previously scheduled a time to meet with the instructor to discuss their
status.

Quizzes are randomized and personalized for each student based upon the most recent
progress report; standards that have already been completely mastered
by a student will not appear on the personalized quiz.

### Marking Quizzes

Each submitted solution will be marked as follows:

* **Mastery Mark ✓**:
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of the given standard.
* **Revision Mark ✱**:
  The solution might demonstrate complete mastery of the given standard,
  but needs to be revised for clarity/accuracy.
* **Issues Mark ⚠**:
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of the given standard,
  but has one or more issues that suggest that further study is required to
  develop complete mastery.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the given
  standard.

Only **✓** contribute to improving a student's letter grade for the course;
all other accumulated marks will be ignored at the end of the semester.
So, a student who earns 42 **✓** and 3 **✘** throughout the semester
will earn the same grade
as a student who earns 42 **✓** and 300 **✘**.

As a rule, at most one **✓** will be awarded to a student
per standard per week.

### Revising Solutions

A student may improve a solution marked as **✱** to **✓** by completing a
[Revision Form][revision-form] outside of class and submitting it on
the date of the next assessment. 
A student submitting a Revision Form cannot also attempt that standard
on a quiz that week.

This submission will be marked as usual, possibly earning another **✱**
that the student should revise further. (Usually at most two revisions
will be allowed per exercise.)

## Advanced Modeling Exercises 

Certain exercises involving modeling will include a second part worth
an additional Advanced Modeling (AM) Mastery Mark **✓**. Up to three of
these may be earned throughout the semester.

## Office Reassessments

During office hours each week, Active students may take advantage of
[Office Reassessments][office-form]. 
Students that satisfactorily
meet the requirements given on the linked form will be given the opportunity
to solve a new exercise on the instructor's whiteboard
that will be immediately marked. 

A student receiving a **✓** in this way may not earn a second **✓**
for the same standard until the following week. Only two reassessments
are allowed per week.

Note that availability for this opportunity may be limited due to
student demand, particularly later in the semester.

## Makeup Quiz

Students that miss one or more quizzes due to an excusable
absence will be allowed to complete a **Makeup Quiz** 
near the end of the semester.
The Makeup Quiz is the same format as a Comprehensive Mastery Quiz,
except the exercises that may be attempted are based upon
which quizzes were excused.

## Final Exam

The **Final Exam** is the same format as a Comprehensive Mastery Quiz,
except that students will have 120 minutes and no revisions will be allowed.

Up to four **✱** marks earned on the Final Exam
will be automatically upgraded to **✓**.

In particular, solving exercises on the Final Exam has
the same benefit as solving exercises on Mastery Quizzes. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **✓**
throughout the entire semester and will only be allowed to earn future
**✓** on a limited number of scheduled quizzes and  the Final Exam,
which must be done by appointment in the instructor's office. In addition,
the incident will be reported to the university.

Any student who is caught cheating twice will automatically receive
an F letter grade for the course.
