## Course Content

The course is split into six **Modules**, each of which is split into
several **Standards** of learning. These are listed on the course
[Standards][standards] page.

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon your mastery of the
twenty-five Course Standards.
Each time you successfully demonstrate
mastery of a Standard by correctly solving a relevant exercise, you will
earn a **✓**. Up to two **✓** per Standard will be awarded, for a maximum
of **50✓**. An additional **3✓** may be earned by solving
**Theory/Application Exercises**.

Letter grades are assigned based on how many **✓** are earned by a student.

* **A**: **48✓**,
  including **3✓** from Theory/Application Exercises.
* **B**: **42✓**.
* **C**: **36✓**.
* **D**: **30✓**.

An unofficial grade of **A+** will be awarded to students who earn **53✓**.
The university does not maintain records of grades higher than **A**, but
the instructor will use this data if asked (e.g.) for a written
recommendation.

## Textbook and Resources

Much of the material for this course will be provided on this website.
Homework will be recommended from *Linear Algebra with Applications (2nd ed)*
by Jeffrey Holt, but students may choose to complete homework from
other sources instead (the first edition, another textbook, the internet,
old quizzes, etc.).

All students are highly encouraged to acquire a calculator that supports
matrix manipulations (row reduction, multiplication, etc.). There are
several cheap/free smart device apps that can provide this functionality
while studying, but unfortunately only a dedicated calculator without
communication functionality and without internet connectivity may be
used during assessments.

## Teams

Teams will be organized near the beginning of the semester. Most
class activities will be done within teams, allowing students to master the
course standards in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

## Class Activities

On a typical day of class,
each team will be seated at a table with a computer station and whiteboard.
The instructor will provide slides that may be viewed at each station.
Students will work through the material covered on these slides within their
teams, with the support of the instructor as needed.

Slides describing **Activities** should be completed by each team on the
provided whiteboard. All details must be shown on the whiteboard (not on
personal notes or scratch paper), and the Activity's number should also
be marked. Each completed activity will be photographed and uploaded to a
Google Drive folder provided by the instructor, to serve as notes for that
team (including students that were absent that day).

## Readiness Assurance

Before each module of the course, students are given a list of materials
for review. Readiness for that module will be assessed on a Readiness
Assurance Test, first individually (iRAT), and then as a team (tRAT).
High scores reflect sufficient preparedness for the module, while low
scores demonstrate a need for further review.

## Mastery Quizzes

Beginning with the second Friday of classes, each Friday is set aside
for a weekly **Mastery Quiz**. Every student will receive a personalized
quiz generated based on their most recent progress report. This generated
quiz will include one exercise for every course Standard covered in class
for which the student can earn a **✓** by demonstrating mastery.
Each student may submit solutions for up to 10 of these exercises each week.
All submissions are due by the end of the class period.

When possible, the full class period will be set aside for these quizzes.
However, up to 25 minutes of Friday classes may be used to wrap up coverage
of material, leaving at least 25 minutes for the Mastery Quiz.

### Marking Quizzes

Each submitted solution will be marked as follows:

* **✓** ("checkmark" or "mastery" mark):
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of the given standard.
* **✱** ("star" or "revision" mark):
  The solution might demonstrate complete mastery of the given standard,
  but needs to be revised for clarity/accuracy.
* **⚠** ("caution" or "issues" mark):
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of the given standard,
  but has one or more issues that suggest that further study is required to
  develop complete mastery.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the given
  standard.

Only **✓** contribute to improving a student's letter grade for the course;
all other accumulated marks will be ignored at the end of the semester.

### Revising Solutions

A student may improve a solution marked as **✱** to **✓** by completing a
[Revision Form][revision-form] outside of class and submitting it on
the upcoming Friday as one of
their ten Mastery Quiz submissions. This submission will be marked
as usual, but the student may not also attempt the exercise for the matching
standard on the Mastery Quiz.

### Appealing Marks

In the rare case of a solution erroneously marked as **⚠**
or **✘** rather than **✱**, the affected student
may complete an [Appeal Form][appeal-form] outside of class and
submitting it on the upcoming Friday as one of their ten Mastery Quiz
submissions.
If the reason for the appeal is accepted, this submission will be marked
as usual; otherwise the submission will not be marked.
The student may not also attempt the exercise for the matching
standard on the Mastery Quiz.

In the extremely rare case of a solution erroneously marked as **✱/⚠/✘**
rather than **✓**, the student may simply
show the solution to the instructor; if no
mistakes can be found in the original submission, the **✓** will be
awarded automatically.

### Office Reassessments

During Wednesday office hours, each student may submit up to
two [Office Reassessment Forms][office-form]. Students that satisfactorily
meet the requirements given on this form will be given the opportunity
to solve a new exercise that will be immediately marked as
usual. Each submitted form counts as one of the students' ten Mastery
Quiz submissions for that week. A student receiving a **✓** in this way may
not also attempt the same standard on that week's Mastery Quiz.

Unless an exception is granted by the instructor,
this privilege is not offered on any other day, but students are encouraged
to meet with the instructor during Monday office hours to discuss
course content.

### Theory/Application Questions

During each Mastery Quiz, each student will have the opportunity to solve a
**Theory/Application Exercise** to demonstrate how to apply the course material
to solve new problems, and is marked similarly to other exercises:

* **✓**:
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of how to apply course
  concepts to the given exercise.
* **✱**:
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of how to apply course
  concepts to the given exercise, but needs to be revised to demonstrate
  mastery.
* **⚠**:
  The solution references some of the relevant concepts covered in class, but
  does not demonstrate satisfactory understanding of how to apply them
  to solve the given exercise.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the
  relevant concepts covered in class or how to apply them to
  the given exercise.

These may be similarly revised and appealed as other solutions, but
cannot be attempted in office hours.

## Final Exam

The **Final Exam** has the exact same structure as the Mastery Quizzes, with
the following exceptions:

* Students have 120 minutes to submit up to twenty solutions.
* Two Theory/Application Exercises are available. Students may submit
  solutions for both.
* Solutions from the last Mastery Quiz marked as **✱** are returned for
  revision during the exam; they must be revised during the exam period.
  Other solutions from the last Mastery Quiz may not be appealed.
* Up to five **✱** (including at most one Theory/Application **✱**)
  will be automatically improved to **✓**. Further **✱** marks cannot
  be improved.

## Makeup Policy

Since any missed exercises may be completely made up on future assessments,
make-up Mastery Quizzes are not available. However, a student may request for
additional time and responses on the Final Exam if they can
demonstrate that their progress has been limited by multiple excusable
absences throughout the semester. Documentation from a medical
professional or university official asking the instructor to excuse an
absence is usually required for this purpose.

## Data Collection

The instructor may also collect the following data to evaluate student
participation and the effectiveness of the course.

- Attendance
- iRAT/tRAT results
- Quality of team responses to class activities uploaded to Google Drive
- Peer evaluation survey feedback
- Variance of student performance within each team
- Collegiality of student interactions during class

This data will not be directly used in assigning letter grades for the
course, but students who have good attendance, score well on readiness
tests, get long with their peers, and so on tend to do well in the course
anyway. This data will also be used by the instructor if (e.g.)
a written recommendation is requested by a student.

Note also that purposeful negligence with regards to the above
(except attendance) will be treated as disruptive academic behavior
and will be addressed as such.
(Refer to [USA's Course Policies][usa-course-policies] for more details.)
