title: "MA 237 Standards"
description: "Linear Algebra - 2018 Spring"
---

Suggested homework exercises for each standard are taken from
*Linear Algebra with Applications (2nd ed)* by Jeffrey Holt.
The **closest examples** to exercises asked on assessments are given in
**bold**.

An overview of course modules is available on
[this introductory handout](../pdf/handout-I.pdf).

Sample solutions for exercises representing each standard are
available in [this handout](../pdf/sample-exercises.pdf).
