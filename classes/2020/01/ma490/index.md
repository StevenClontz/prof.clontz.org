## Course Content

A course on 
[two-player combinatorial games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory), 
including a study of Conway's 
[surreal number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number), 
as well as an introduction to contemporary research on 
[infinite-length games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory#Infinitely_long_games) 
and their applications in mathematics.

Much of the course will be taken from John Conway's text
[On Numbers and Games][text].
An outline of topics follows.

- Intuition and examples of surreal numbers (Chapter 0)
- Field properties of surreal numbers (Chapter 1)
- Real and ordinal numbers (Chapter 2)
- Finite-length combinatorial games (Chapter 7)
- Games vs. numbers (Chapters 8-9)
- Impartial games (Chapter 11)
- Infinite-length combinatorial games
- Contemporary research on games

## Assessment and Grading

At the end of each topic, a quiz will be given covering that material,
including several multiple choice questions and one full-response
question. Each mutiple-choice quesiton is worth one point, and the
full-response question is worth two points. A topic is considered
Mastered if the student earns at least as many points as there are
multiple-choice questions.

Unmastered topics will be quizzed again on the midterm and final;
students that Mastered the topic previously may skip those sections.

Graduate students will give a presentation on a topic of their choice
toward the end of the course that counts as an extra topic.
A satisfactory presentation demonstrates Mastery of the topic.

Letter grades are assigned based on the number of topics Mastered. 
- **A**: all but one topic Mastered.
- **B**: all but two topics Mastered.
- **C**: all but three topics Mastered.
- **D**: all but four topics Mastered.

## Midterm and Final Exam

As stated above, the midterm and final exam will be comprehensive,
with the opportunity to Master any previously Unmastered topics.
Some topics may appear for the first time on these exams, rather
than on an individual quiz.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will permanently forfeit all credit earned for the
relevant area of the course (Discussions, Presentations,
Content Mastery, Proofs, or the Final Exam) as well as
be deducted one letter grade.
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

A second instance of academic dishonesty will immediately
result in an F for the course.
