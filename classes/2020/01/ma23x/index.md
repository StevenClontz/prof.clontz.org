## COVID-19 Mitigation Plan


The remaining content for the course will be delivered prerecorded
videos uploaded to Panopto, weekly office hours,
and feedback on weekly quiz attempts. Here is the weekly schedule:

### Tuesdays

You should watch the 
[videos on USAOnline (Panopto tab)](https://ecampus.southalabama.edu/portal/directtool/c3cda410-70e7-4ae0-ab0a-9c87d30cd7f8/) (use your Jag# with your Jagmail password)
and attempt
[practice exercises](https://masterit.clontz.org) related to the
material being assessed on Thursday's quiz (see below). MA237 students
may also use the [MA 237 course slides](pdf/ma237-course-slides.pdf),
and I've made my [MA 238 fall lecture notes](https://drive.google.com)
for the second half of the semester available on our shared Google Drive.

Also, a quiz
covering standards from earlier in the semester is available each Tuesday
(replacing office reassessments),
submitted on Gradescope.
You may attempt
any of these, but you are required to upload photos of work on 5 exercises from
<https://masterit.clontz.org> for each standard you attempt.
Your options for this quiz are outlined in your course calendar.

### Wednesdays

I will hold virtual office hours via Google Meet on Wednesdays 9am-4pm
and 9pm-10pm at this link: <https://meet.google.com/ddp-mwmo-hgj>.
Please log in using your Jagmail account. This is your chance to follow up
with the prerecorded videos with questions, or show me your attempts at
solving the practice exercises.

### Thursdays

Each Thursday, a quiz covering newer standards will become available
to view/download/print. Using the printout or any other paper, you will write full
solutions for each exercise, photograph your work, and upload to Gradescope before
the end of the day.
Your course calendar lists which standards are included on each quiz.

### Info on grading

For all submissions, I will give minimal feedback on the first pass to get results
back to you as quickly as possible; if possible, you should try to figure out
specific mistakes for yourself to help you learn from them. However, you may use the
"Regrade Request" feature on any of your submissions for me to provide more detailed
feedback (or ask for feedback during office hours).

### Revising submissions

Submissions marked as revisable with a star (on both Tues/Thurs quizzes) may be revised
by sending me an email with a photograph of your revision. Please include all the information
asked on the [Revision Form](https://prof.clontz.org/classes/2020/01/ma23x/pdf/revision-form.pdf).

### Grading 

Final grades will be reported according to the original syllabus.

### Active/Inactive

All enrolled students are considered "Active" for the remainder of the semester.

### Communication

I will send emails each Monday with updates.

### Progress Reports

I've shared a Google Drive spreadsheet with each student that is periodically synced to my gradebook
for progress reporting. Log into Google Drive with your Jagmail to view it.

## Textbook and Resources

All required material for this course will be provided on the course website
or uploaded to Google Drive.

The textbook carried in the univeristy bookstore will not be required.

The use of any calculator is allowed on assessments, 
as long as it does not support communication
functionality or internet connectivity.

### MA237 calculator

Linear algebra students will greatly benefit
from a calculator that has an RREF function supporting matrices as large
as \\(6\times 6\\).

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon your mastery of the
Course Standards. Each time you successfully demonstrate
mastery of a Standard by correctly completing a relevant task, you will
earn a **Mastery Mark ✓**. Up to two **✓** per Standard may be earned from
in-class exercises, and one **✓** per Standard is available for at-home projects.
 
Letter grades are assigned based on how much content was learned
by each student, measured by how many **✓** were earned.

- MA237 Linear Algebra (out of 48 possible)
  - **A**: **45✓**
  - **B**: **40✓**
  - **C**: **35✓**
  - **D**: **30✓**
- MA238 Differential Equations (out of 40 possible)
  - **A**: **38✓**
  - **B**: **34✓**
  - **C**: **30✓**
  - **D**: **26✓**

## Student Data

Grade data will be provided to students via regular
printed progress reports. Students are also highly encouraged to
opt-in to using the [Gradescope][gradescope] platform to receive instant
notficiation of assignment results via email and the web.

## Active/Inactive Students

By default all students are considered **Active** in the course. However,
students that meet any of the following criteria may be designated as
**Inactive**:

- Accumulating two unexcused absences within three weeks of each other.
- Failing a Readiness Quiz. 
- Receiving excessive negative feedback (more than one standard
  deviation lower than the mean) on a Peer Evaluation Survey
  (or neglecting to complete it).

When a student becomes Inactive, they will receive an email from the
instructor requesting an appointment. At this appointment the student
will make an agreement with the instructor to address the issues that
caused the Inactive status, and will return to Active status provided
this agreement is kept.

## Teams

**Teams** will be organized near the beginning of the semester. Much of
our class meetings will be spent in teams completing activities related
to the material, allowing students to master the
course standards in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

If any student from the class submits a request to the instructor 
by email to do so, a
**Peer Evaluation Survey** will be conducted to allow teammates to
provide anonymous feedback to each other.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken daily.
Generally, only absences that have been previously approved by the
instructor or that are related to a medical issue (with accompanying
documentation from a medical professional) will be considered excused.
All excused absences must be documented via email with the instructor.

## Readiness Assurance

Before each module of the course, students are given a 
list of materials
for review. Readiness for that module will be assessed on a **Readiness
Quiz**, first individually and then as a team.
High scores reflect sufficient preparedness for the module, while low
scores demonstrate a need for further review.
A 70% average of both quizzes is required to pass this quiz.

## Class Activities

Frequently, teams will be required to complete various activities.
When these involve writing out a full solution on a whiteboard,
teams should photograph and upload this work to Google Drive.

## Mastery Quizzes

During most class days,
Active students will be able to complete a short **Mastery Quiz**.
(Submissions by Inactive students will not be counted.)
A schedule of which standards are covered on each quiz is available on
the Calendar; generally, each standard appears 3 times
before it is rotated off the daily quiz schedule.

In addition, all students will
be offered two 75-minute **Comprehensive Mastery Quizzes**
and a 120-minute **Final Exam**
that include exercises for every standard covered
in the class to that date. Inactive students can receive credit for these.

### Marking Quizzes

Each submitted solution will be marked as follows:

* **Mastery Mark ✓**:
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of the given standard.
* **Revision Mark ✱**:
  The solution might demonstrate mastery of the given standard,
  but needs to be revised for clarity/accuracy.
* **Issues Mark ⓘ**:
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of the given standard,
  but has one or more issues that suggest that further study is required to
  develop complete mastery.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the given
  standard.

Only **✓** affect a student's letter grade for the course;
all other accumulated marks will be ignored at the end of the semester.
So, a student who earns 35 **✓** and 3 **✘** throughout the semester
will earn the same grade
as a student who earns 35 **✓** and 300 **✘**.

Once a standard has been "mastered" (both **✓** have been earned),
there is no need to complete another exercise of that type.

### Revising Solutions

On any assessment besides the final exam,
a student may improve a solution marked as **✱** to **✓** by completing a
[Revision Form][revision-form] outside of class and promptly submitting
it in class, usually the following Tuesday. 

This submission will be marked as usual, with at most one additional
re-revision allowed in the case of a very minor mistake.

## Office Reassessments

During office hours each week, Active students may take advantage of
[Office Reassessments][office-form]. 
Students that satisfactorily
meet the requirements given on the linked form will be given the opportunity
to solve a new exercise to earn **✓**.

Note that availability for this opportunity may be limited due to
student demand, particularly later in the semester, so it's best to
take advantage of this early.

## Missed Quizzes 

Students that miss one or more quizzes due to excused
absences may request additional time on a Comprehensive Mastery Quiz
or the Final Exam.

## Take-Home Projects (MA238)

Some differential equations standards are too involved to be assessed
on timed daily quizzes. Instead, each student will complete a take-home project
based on that topic. Each project will have one or more submission deadlines;
after each deadline, the instructor will mark the submitted project with
**✓**, **ⓘ**, or **✘**. If a **✓** is not awarded, the student may
revise and resubmit the same project at the next submission deadline.
Even once all submission deadlines have passed, any project may be submitted
for credit at the final exam.

## Final Exam

The **Final Exam** is the same format as a Comprehensive Mastery Quiz,
except that students will have 120 minutes and no revisions will be allowed.
Instead, up to three **✱** marks earned on the Final Exam
will be automatically upgraded to **✓**.

In particular, demonstrating mastery on the Final Exam has
the same benefit as demonstrating mastery on Mastery Quizzes
throughout the semester, so students who keep up with the
material throughout the semester will have a shorter final
than students who attempt to cram everything in at the last minute. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **✓**
throughout the entire semester, will become permanently Inactive in the course,
and will have to take the remaining assessments by appointment
in the instructor's office.
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

Any student who is caught cheating twice will automatically receive
an F letter grade for the course.
