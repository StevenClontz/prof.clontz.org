## Course Information

* Semester: 2019 May
* Title: Linear Algebra
* Sections: MA 237-111
  * MTWRF 9:00am-11:46am
  * MSPB 360
* Office Hours
  * MTWR 01:00pm-03:00pm
  * MSPB 314

## Course Content

The course is split into five **Modules**, each of which is split into
several [**Standards**][standards] of learning.

## Textbook and Resources

Much of the material for this course will be provided on the course website
or uploaded to [Google Drive](drive/).

The textbook carried in the univeristy bookstore is available for reference,
but will not be required.
A free online respository of [notes][slides] and 
[homework exercises][homework] will be provided instead.

The use of any calculator is allowed on assessments, 
as long as it does not support communication
functionality or internet connectivity. Students will
need a calculuator that supports computing reduced
row echelon form ("RREF"), or may use a provided table
of [RREFs][rref]. 

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon your mastery of the
Course Standards. Each time you successfully demonstrate
mastery of a Standard by correctly completing a relevant exercise, you will
earn a **Mastery Mark ✓**. Up to two **✓** per Standard will be awarded
for the 24 standards, for a maximum of 48 **✓**. Two additional
**✓** may be earned on the final exam for answering questions related to
applications of linear algebra discussed at the end of the course.

Letter grades are assigned based on how much content was learned
by each student, measured by how many **✓** were earned.

* **A**: **46✓**
* **B**: **41✓**
* **C**: **36✓**
* **D**: **31✓**

## Student Data

Grade data will be provided to students via regular
printed progress reports. Students are also highly encouraged to
opt-in to using the [Gradescope][gradescope] platform to receive instant
notficiation of assignment results via email and the web.

## Active/Inactive Students

By default all students are considered **Active** in the course. However,
students that meet any of the following criteria may be designated as
**Inactive**:

- Accumulating two or more unexcused absences.
- Failing a Readiness Quiz. 
- Receiving excessive negative feedback on a Peer Evaluation Survey
  (or neglecting to complete it).

When a student meets any of these criteria, they will receive an email 
from the instructor with a list of requirements to maintain their Active status,
along with a deadline. Inactive status may be returned to Active status
only at the discretion of the instructor.

## Teams

**Teams** will be organized near the beginning of the semester. Much of
our class meetings will be spent in teams completing activities related
to the material, allowing students to master the
course standards in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

If any student from the class submits a request to the instructor 
by email to do so, a
**Peer Evaluation Survey** will be conducted to allow teammates to
provide anonymous feedback to each other.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken daily.
Generally, only absences that have been previously approved by the
instructor or that are related to a medical issue (with accompanying
documentation from a medical professional) will be considered excused.
All excused absences must be documented via email with the instructor.

## Readiness Assurance

Periodically throughout the course, students will be given a 
list of materials for review. Preparedness will then
be assessed on a multiple-choice **Readiness
Quiz**, first individually and then as a team.
High scores reflect sufficient preparedness for the module, while low
scores demonstrate a need for further review.
A 70% average of both quizzes is required to pass this quiz.
Students who do not pass the quiz will be given an opportunity to submit
a full-response retake of the quiz to the instructor.

## Class Activities

Students will be led through each [Standard][standards] by a sequence
of team activies designed to break down each concept.
These should be completed by each team on the
provided whiteboard, showing all details. Photos of this work will then be 
uploaded to Google Drive.

## Mastery Quizzes

During most class days,
Active students will be able to complete a short **Mastery Quiz**.
Each standard covered in class will appear on up to three Mastery Quizzes.
A schedule of which standards are covered on each quiz is available on
the [Calendar][calendar].
Inactive students will not receive credit for these quizzes.

In addition, during the last week of class
all students (Active and Inactive) will
be offered a full-class **Comprehensive Mastery Quiz**
and **Final Exam**
that include exercises for every standard covered
in the class to that date.

Quizzes are randomized and personalized for each student based upon their
current progress; standards that have already been completely mastered
by a student will not be assigned on the personalized quiz.

### Marking Quizzes

Each submitted solution will be marked as follows:

* **Mastery Mark ✓**:
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of the given standard.
* **Revision Mark ✱**:
  The solution might demonstrate mastery of the given standard,
  but needs to be revised for clarity/accuracy.
* **Issues Mark ⓘ**:
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of the given standard,
  but has one or more issues that suggest that further study is required to
  develop complete mastery.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the given
  standard.

Only **✓** affect a student's letter grade for the course;
all other accumulated marks will be ignored at the end of the semester.
So, a student who earns 37 **✓** and 3 **✘** throughout the semester
will earn the same grade
as a student who earns 37 **✓** and 300 **✘**.

### Revising Solutions

A student may improve a solution marked as **✱** to **✓** by completing a
[Revision Form][revision-form] outside of class and promptly submitting
it within two class days of the quiz. 

This submission will be marked as usual, with at most one additional
re-revision allowed in the case of a very minor mistake.

## Office Reassessments

During office hours, Active students may take advantage of
Office Reassessments. Students that meet the requirements given on the 
[Office Reassessment Form][office-form] will be given the opportunity
to solve a new exercise for credit.

Students may earn at most one **✓** in this way each day, resulting in
about ten maximum for the course.

## Missed Quizzes 

Students that miss one or more Mastery Quizzes due to excused
absences will be given extra time on the Final Exam. 

## Final Exam

The **Final Exam** is the same format as a Comprehensive Mastery Quiz,
except that no revisions will be allowed.
Instead, up to five **✱** marks earned on the Final Exam
will be automatically upgraded to **✓**.

## Suggested Daily Schedule

Due to the very quick pacing of the course, I recommend you follow
a daily schedule similar to:

- 8:30-9:00am: Review for daily Mastery Quiz
- 9:00-11:46am: Class
- 11:46am-01:00pm: Lunch (while instructor grades quizzes)
- 1:00-2:30pm: Office Hours (Reassessments and instructor questions)
- Afternoon/Evening: Practice homework exercises

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **✓**
throughout the entire semester, will become permanently Inactive in the course,
and will have to take the remaining assessments by appointment
in the instructor's office.
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

Any student who is caught cheating twice will automatically receive
an F letter grade for the course.
