## Course Content

This course is a survey of various topics currently researched in general topology. 
To this end, students will be provided a
[Theorem Sequence][thm-seq] outlining several results from the field. 

In particular, the following areas will be covered this semester:
- Introductory set theory, particularly ordinals and cardinals
- Topological games
- Function spaces
- Linearly-ordered spaces 

## Grading

For undergraduates, grades in this course are determined based upon satisfactory completion
of four grade specifications:

- **Presentations** 
- **Notes**
- **Knowledge** 
- **Proofs**

Letter grades are assigned at the end of the semester as follows:

- A: All specifications satisfied
- B: 3/4 specifications satisfied
- C: 2/4 specifications satisfied
- D: 1/4 specifications satisfied
- F: No specifications satisfied

### Project specification for grad students

Graduate students will have an additional **Project** specification,
described below. Letter grades for graduate students will be assigned at
the end of the semester as follows:

- A: 5/5 specifications satisfied
- B: 4/5 specifications satisfied
- C: 3/5 specifications satisfied
- D: 2/5 specifications satisfied
- F: 1/5 or less specifications satisfied

## Textbook and Resources

No textbook is required for this course; in fact, using a text is
generally discouraged. Students will be provided a [Theorem Sequence][thm-seq]
that outlines all the content that may be covered in the course, and students
will be tasked with presenting original proofs for these facts.

## Presentations

The majority of in-class time will be spent on presentations.
Each Wednesday, the students will choose items from the [Theorem Sequence][thm-seq]
to attempt to prove by the next week. Written proofs will be shown to the
instructor at the beginning of class on Monday. Students will present these results
during class that week; with the opportunity to make adjustments from Monday to
Wednesday as needed. If stuck, the student may use the instructor or outside
resources to assist in this task (but is encouraged to do so as little as possible),
or even request a change in assignment.

### Satisfying the Presentation Specification

Students who satisfactorally prepare and present their results for 12/15 weeks throughout
the semester will have satisfied this specification.

## Notes

All students are expected to keep a \\(\LaTeX\\) notebook containing proofs of
all theorems presented during class by their peers. The easiest way to do this is by using
[Overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com). 

### Satisfying the Notes Specification

Around two-thirds through the semester, students will submit their notebooks (PDF+source)
to the instructor. These notes will be evaluated based upon coverage of course presentations
and accuracy of a handful of secretly chosen items.

If the notebook is deemed satsifactory, that student will have satisfied this specification.
Otherwise, the student will meet with the instructor to determine what revisions
must be made before resubmission during finals, at which time the notebook will be
reassessed based upon those revisions. A satisfactory resubmission will also
satisfy this specification.

## Knowledge 

Periodically multiple-choice closed-note Knowledge Quizzes will be given during class
to assess coverage of the four areas outlined above in Course Content. 
Up to five questions from each topic will be asked.

Students that answer all of the questions correctly are considered to have
"satisfied" that topic. Otherwise, the topic may be reattempted on a future quiz.
Additional opportunties to satisfy these topics will be provided during the final exam (see below).

### Satisfying the Knowledge Specification

Students that satisify all the topics of the course will have satisfied this specification.

## Proofs

Three open-note Proof Quizzes will be given during the regular semester, each including five exercises.
Up to three proofs/solutions may be submitted for each quiz.
The instructor will mark these submissions for understanding, and sufficiently supported
arguments will be allowed to be typeset and (if needed) revised for final submission.
Additional opportunties to submit proofs will be provided during the final exam (see below).

### Satisfying the Proofs Specification

Each satsifactorally typeset proof is worth one point. Students who earn at least 8 points
by the end of the semester will have satisfied this specification.

## Project

Each graduate student will choose a topic related, but not directly covered,
by our course content, with the advice of the instructor. They will then
complete a project based upon that topic, the scope of 
which will be agreed upon with the instructor. 

### Satisfying the Project Specification

A draft of this project may be submitted as desired during
the semester, and will either be accepted as satisfactory, or returned with
suggested revisions. The response time for project submissions may
increase with each submission.

Graduate students who have a project accepted as satisfactory will have
satisfied this specification.

## Final Exam

The Final Exam will be a combination of a Knowledge Quiz and Proof Quiz,
which can be used to help students complete the Knowledge and Proof
Specifications. Proofs will not need to be typeset, and will be accepted
with minor errors.

## Makeup Policy

Due to the nature of assessment in this course, quiz makeups are not needed
and won't be offered since that credit may be made up on future quizzes.
However, additional time may be given on the Final Exam by request 
to students who have one or more excusable absences. Also, in exceptional
cases the requirements to meet other specifications may be
lowered due to multiple excusable absences.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **âœ“**, either for
the relevant specification or the whole semester as appropriate. In addition,
the incident will be reported to the university.

In particular, cheating includes copy-pasting and blind rewriting of
results from other students, books, or the internet and submitting
these results as original work (i.e. plagarism). \\(\LaTeX\\) source files
may be required to assist with automatic detection of plagarized work.
