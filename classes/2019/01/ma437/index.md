## Course Information

- Semester: 2019 Spring 
- Title: Complex Variables 
- Section:
    - MA 437-501
- Class Time:
    - TR 6:00-7:15pm
    - MSPB 360
- Office Hours
    - TBA 
    - MSPB 314

## Course Content

This course will focus on six main modules as covered
in our [text][text]:

- Algebra of complex numbers
- Analytic functions
- Examples of complex functions
- Integrals
- Series
- Residues and Poles 

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon satisfactory completion
of four grade specifications:

- **Presentation** 
- **Computation**
- **Knowledge** 
- **Proof**

Letter grades are assigned at the end of the semester as follows:

- A: All specifications satisfied
- B: 3/4 specifications satisfied
- C: 2/4 specifications satisfied
- D: 1/4 specifications satisfied
- F: No specifications satisfied

## Textbook and Resources

We will use the free textbook
[A First Course in Undergraduate Complex Analysis][text].
This inquiry-based learning textbook outlines the major ideas for
the course, and we will spend the majority of our class time
presenting solutions and proofs to fill in its gaps. 

## Presentation

On the first day of class, students will be assigned to teams.
The majority of in-class time will be spent on presentations
within each team. Each week, the instructor will choose which
topics should be presented, and each team will decide how to 
distribute these presentations within their team.

Presentations should be photographed and uploaded to
the class [Google Drive][drive].

### Satisfying the Presentation Specification

Each week, team members will complete an online form rating
their teammates contribution for that week, summing to a
total of 100%. (For example, a student with five teammates
could rank all five as 20%, or rank one 60% and the four others
10%.) 

Students whose average contribution rating
is 15% or better at the end of the semester will have
satisfied this specification. Students receiving at least 10%
but less than 15% will also satisfy this specification, provided 
that they also satisfy two other specifications.

## Assessments

The other three specifications are achieved based upon success
on assessments given periodically during the course:

- Thurs Feb 7
- Thurs Mar 7
- Thurs Apr 4
- Final Exam (May, TBA)

Assessments are cumulative; however, only sections that have
not already been Mastered need be attempted (see below).
If an assessment is missed due to an excusable absence,
additional time on future assessments may be requested.

## Computation

Each assessment will include a multiple-choice Computation section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.

### Satisfying the Computation Specification

Students who correctly answer at least 70% of the questions in
the Computation section for a module will have Mastered
that module's Computations.

Students who Master the Computations for at least 5 modules
will have satisfied this specification.

## Knowledge 

Each assessment will include a true/false Knowledge section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.

### Satisfying the Knowledge Specification

Students who correctly answer at least 70% of the questions in
the Knowledge section for a module will have Mastered
that module's Knowledge.

Students who Master the Knowledge for at least 5 modules
will have satisfied this specification.

## Proofs

Each assessment will include a Proof section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.
Each section will include one or more exercises that may
be attempted, but only one Proof solution per module may be submitted.
In addition, at most two Proof solutions total may be submitted
per assessment (with the exception of the Final Exam).

### Satisfying the Proofs Specification

Proofs will be marked as Mastered, Revisable, Has Issues,
or Negligible Progress. Revisable proofs may be revised
and resubmitted in a timely fashion to improve to Mastered. 
At the end of the semester, one Has Issues proof may be 
revised and resubmitted to improve to Mastered.

Students who have submitted a Mastered Proof for at least
5 modules will have satisfied this specification.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately forfeit any credit earned for the
Computation, Knowledge, and Proof specifications.
This credit may be reearned on subsequent assessments,
which will be given in the instructor's office by appointment. 
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

A second instance of academic dishonesty will immediately
result in an F for the course.
