## Course Content

This course will focus on six main modules as covered
in our [text][text]:

- Algebra of complex numbers
- Analytic functions
- Examples of complex functions
- Integrals
- Series
- Residues and Poles 

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon satisfactory completion
of four grade specifications:

- **Presentation** 
- **Computation**
- **Knowledge** 
- **Proof**

Letter grades are assigned at the end of the semester as follows:

- A: All specifications satisfied
- B: 3/4 specifications satisfied
- C: 2/4 specifications satisfied
- D: 1/4 specifications satisfied
- F: No specifications satisfied

## Textbook and Resources

We will use the free textbook
[A First Course in Undergraduate Complex Analysis][text].
This inquiry-based learning textbook outlines the major ideas for
the course, and we will spend the majority of our class time
presenting solutions and proofs to fill in its gaps. 

## Presentation

Each student is expected to prepare and give approximately one presentation per week
during class. The instructor will assign the topic, but students
are welcome to request changes in assignment as needed. To get credit
for presenting, the student must prepare written notes to accompany
the presentation.
Presentations will be accepted as long as a good-faith effort
was made in their preparation.

### Satisfying the Presentation Specification

Students who miss at most one assigned presentation will have satisifed
this specifciation. 

Students who miss two or more presentations will
be assigned a take-home project due by the date of the final exam, the scope of
which will be based upon the number of missed presentations; 
completion of this project will satisfy this specification as well.

## Assessments

The other three specifications are achieved based upon success
on assessments given periodically during the course:

- Thurs Feb 14
- Thurs Mar 14
- Thurs Apr 11
- Tues Apr 30, 6pm-8pm (Final Exam)

Assessments are cumulative; however, only sections that have
not already been Mastered need be attempted (see below).
If an assessment is missed due to an excusable absence,
additional time on future assessments may be requested.

## Computation

Each assessment will include a multiple-choice Computation section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.

### Satisfying the Computation Specification

Students who correctly answer at least 70% of the questions in
the Computation section for a module will have Mastered
that module's Computations.

Students who Master the Computations for at least 5 modules
will have satisfied this specification.

## Knowledge 

Each assessment will include a true/false Knowledge section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.

### Satisfying the Knowledge Specification

Students who correctly answer at least 70% of the questions in
the Knowledge section for a module will have Mastered
that module's Knowledge.

Students who Master the Knowledge for at least 5 modules
will have satisfied this specification.

## Proofs

Each assessment will include a Proof section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.
Each section will include one or more exercises that may
be attempted, but only one Proof solution per module may be submitted.
In addition, at most two Proof solutions total may be submitted
per assessment (with the exception of the Final Exam).

### Satisfying the Proofs Specification

Proofs will be marked as Mastered, Revisable, Has Issues,
or Negligible Progress. Revisable proofs may be revised
and resubmitted in a timely fashion to improve to Mastered. 
At the end of the semester, one Has Issues proof may be 
revised and resubmitted to improve to Mastered.

Students who have submitted a Mastered Proof for at least
5 modules will have satisfied this specification.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately forfeit any credit earned for the
Computation, Knowledge, and Proof specifications.
This credit may be reearned on subsequent assessments,
which will be given in the instructor's office by appointment. 
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

A second instance of academic dishonesty will immediately
result in an F for the course.
