## Course Information

* Semester: 2019 Fall
* Title: Differential Equations
* Sections: MA 238-101
  * TR 9:30am-10:45am
  * MSPB 360
* Office Hours
  * TR 10:45am-01:45pm
  * MSPB 314

## Course Content

The course is split into five **Modules**, each of which is split into
several [**Standards**][standards] of learning.

In particular, our course standards are aligned with the following
learning outcomes defined by the Association of American Colleges & Universities:

- Convert relevant information into various mathematical forms 
  (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).

## Textbook and Resources

Much of the material for this course will be provided on the course website
or uploaded to [Google Drive](drive/).

The textbook carried in the univeristy bookstore will not be required.
A free online respository of homework exercises will be provided instead.

The use of any calculator is allowed on assessments, 
as long as it does not support communication
functionality or internet connectivity.

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon your mastery of the
Course Standards. Each time you successfully demonstrate
mastery of a Standard by correctly completing a relevant exercise/project, you will
earn a **Mastery Mark ✓**. Up to two **✓** per Standard will be awarded
for the 16 non-modeling standards, and one **✓** per Standard will be awarded
for the 8 modeling standards, for a maximum of 40 **✓**.

Letter grades are assigned based on how much content was learned
by each student, measured by how many **✓** were earned.

* **A**: **38✓**
* **B**: **33✓**
* **C**: **28✓**
* **D**: **23✓**

## Student Data

Grade data will be provided to students via regular
printed progress reports. Students are also highly encouraged to
opt-in to using the [Gradescope][gradescope] platform to receive instant
notficiation of assignment results via email and the web.

## Active/Inactive Students

By default all students are considered **Active** in the course. However,
students that meet any of the following criteria may be designated as
**Inactive**:

- Accumulating two unexcused absences within three weeks of each other.
- Failing a Readiness Quiz. 
- Receiving excessive negative feedback on a Peer Evaluation Survey
  (or neglecting to complete it).

Such students may be returned
to Active status by making an appointment and meeting with the instructor
and signing a contract to address the issues that caused them to fall
Inactive. A student that becomes Inactive three times will remain Inactive
permanently for the semester.

## Teams

**Teams** will be organized near the beginning of the semester. Much of
our class meetings will be spent in teams completing activities related
to the material, allowing students to master the
course standards in an environment where they may discuss topics and ask
questions freely with their peers and the instructor.

If any student from the class submits a request to the instructor 
by email to do so, a
**Peer Evaluation Survey** will be conducted to allow teammates to
provide anonymous feedback to each other.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken daily.
Generally, only absences that have been previously approved by the
instructor or that are related to a medical issue (with accompanying
documentation from a medical professional) will be considered excused.
All excused absences must be documented via email with the instructor.

## Readiness Assurance

Before each module of the course, students are given a 
[list of materials](readiness)
for review. Readiness for that module will be assessed on a **Readiness
Quiz**, first individually and then as a team.
High scores reflect sufficient preparedness for the module, while low
scores demonstrate a need for further review.
A 70% average of both quizzes is required to pass this quiz.

## Class Activities

The instructor will introduce each course [Standard][standards],
providing theory, formulas, and examples. After this introduction,
students will collaborate on one or more team activities similar to exercises
that will be assigned for that standard.
These should be completed by each team on the
provided whiteboard, showing all details and uploaded to Google Drive.

## Mastery Quizzes

During most class days,
Active students will be able to complete a short **Mastery Quiz**.
Each non-modeling standard covered in class will appear on up to three Mastery Quizzes,
at most once a week.
A schedule of which standards are covered on each quiz is available on
the [Calendar][calendar].

Submissions by Inactive students will not be marked unless 
they have previously scheduled a time to meet with the instructor to discuss their
status.

In addition, all students will
be offered two 75-minute **Comprehensive Mastery Quizzes**
and a 120-minute **Final Exam**
that include exercises for every standard covered
in the class to that date.

Quizzes are randomized and personalized for each student based upon their
current progress; standards that have already been completely mastered
by a student will not be assigned on the personalized quiz.

### Marking Quizzes

Each submitted solution will be marked as follows:

* **Mastery Mark ✓**:
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of the given standard.
* **Revision Mark ✱**:
  The solution might demonstrate mastery of the given standard,
  but needs to be revised for clarity/accuracy.
* **Issues Mark ⓘ**:
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of the given standard,
  but has one or more issues that suggest that further study is required to
  develop complete mastery.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the given
  standard.

Only **✓** affect a student's letter grade for the course;
all other accumulated marks will be ignored at the end of the semester.
So, a student who earns 35 **✓** and 3 **✘** throughout the semester
will earn the same grade
as a student who earns 35 **✓** and 300 **✘**.

### Revising Solutions

A student may improve a solution marked as **✱** to **✓** by completing a
[Revision Form][revision-form] outside of class and promptly submitting
it in class, usually the following Tuesday. 

This submission will be marked as usual, with at most one additional
re-revision allowed in the case of a very minor mistake.

## Modeling Projects 

As they are covered in class, individualized take-home projects will
be assigned based upon the modeling standards. 
These will be marked similarly to quizzes, except that
all submissions may be revised for an improved mark. 

Keep in mind
that while the first submission will be marked promptly by the
instructor upon its due date, further revisions will be marked
based on the instructor's availability. 
Since projects with even minor errors will be marked as **✱**
and will require corrections, it's highly encouraged 
that students write in pencil or
type up their projects so they can be easily revised.

Project revisions are due
either on the last day of class or the date of the final exam (depending
on when the project was assigned). 

## Office Reassessments

During office hours each week, Active students may take advantage of
[Office Reassessments][office-form]. 
Students that satisfactorily
meet the requirements given on the linked form will be given the opportunity
to solve a new exercise for credit.

Note that availability for this opportunity may be limited due to
student demand, particularly later in the semester.

## Missed Quizzes 

Students that miss one or more quizzes due to excused
absences may request additional time on the second Comprehensive Mastery Quiz
held near the end of the semester.

## Final Exam

The **Final Exam** is the same format as a Comprehensive Mastery Quiz,
except that students will have 120 minutes and no revisions will be allowed.
Instead, up to four **✱** marks earned on the Final Exam
will be automatically upgraded to **✓**.

In particular, demonstrating mastery on the Final Exam has
the same benefit as demonstrating mastery on Mastery Quizzes
throughout the semester, so students who keep up with the
material throughout the semester will have a shorter final
than students who attempt to cram everything in at the last minute. 

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately lose credit for all earned **✓**
throughout the entire semester, will become permanently Inactive in the course,
and will have to take the remaining assessments by appointment
in the instructor's office.
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

Any student who is caught cheating twice will automatically receive
an F letter grade for the course.
