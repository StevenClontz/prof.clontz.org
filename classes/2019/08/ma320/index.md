    - TR 2:00-3:15pm
    - HUMB TBA

## Course Content

A transition to higher mathematics with an emphasis on proof techniques. 
Topics include symbolic logic, elementary set theory, induction, relations, 
functions, and the structure of the number system. 

We will spend most of our class time working through freely available
[course notes][notes]. A textbook is available in the bookstore or online,
*Bridge to Higher Mathematics*, by Sam Vandervelde, but it is not required. 

## Grading

Grades in this course are determined based upon satisfactory completion
of four grade specifications:

- **Discussions** 
- **Presentations** 
- **Knowledge** 
- **Proofs**

Letter grades are assigned at the end of the semester as follows:

- A: All specifications satisfied
- B: 3/4 specifications satisfied
- C: 2/4 specifications satisfied
- D: 1/4 specifications satisfied
- F: No specifications satisfied

## Discussions

Each Thursday, students will be assigned a portion of the course notes
to review over the weekend before class meets again on Tuesday. This material
will be discussed online at TODO.

Based on this score, each student will be assigned a requirement between 60% and 90%
that must be earned on the final exam to satisfy this specification. In particular,
the student that has the best discussion score will only need to earn 60% on the final
to satisfy this specification, but the student with the worst discussion score will
need to earn closer to 90%.

## Presentations

When assigning weekend notes to review, some of the problems will be assigned 
to specific students to be presented during the next week of class.
After each student presentation, the other students will submit a rating of the
presentation.

Based upon these rating, each student will be assigned a requirement between 60%
and 90%
that must be earned on the final exam to satisfy this specification. In particular,
the student that has the best discussion score will only need to earn 60% on the final
to satisfy this specification, but the student with the worst discussion score will
need to earn closer to 90%.

### Adjustment of Final Exam Requirement

If both the discussion and presentation final exam requirements are within 10%,
then the lower requirement will be changed to be 10% less than the higher requirement.

## Knowledge 

As material is covered, certain topics (called [Standards][standards]) 
will be assessed on periodic Knowledge Quizzes.

(TODO add check/star/etc rating scale)

Half of the credit on the final exam will be based upon these standards, and if
an exercise is answered correctly on the final, it will still count toward this
specification.

Students that master X/Y standards by the end of the semester will satisfy this
specification.

## Proofs

This course is designated as a [Writing-Intensive Course][WIC] by the university.
As such, students are required to maintain a Proofs Portfolio over the course of
the semester. This portfolio will include one example of each of the types of
proofs we will cover in this course. 

The other three specifications are achieved based upon success
on assessments given periodically during the course:

- Thurs Feb 14
- Thurs Mar 14
- Thurs Apr 11
- Tues Apr 30, 6pm-8pm (Final Exam)

Assessments are cumulative; however, only sections that have
not already been Mastered need be attempted (see below).
If an assessment is missed due to an excusable absence,
additional time on future assessments may be requested.

## Computation

Each assessment will include a multiple-choice Computation section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.

### Satisfying the Computation Specification

Students who correctly answer at least 70% of the questions in
the Computation section for a module will have Mastered
that module's Computations.

Students who Master the Computations for at least 5 modules
will have satisfied this specification.

## Knowledge 

Each assessment will include a true/false Knowledge section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.

### Satisfying the Knowledge Specification

Students who correctly answer at least 70% of the questions in
the Knowledge section for a module will have Mastered
that module's Knowledge.

Students who Master the Knowledge for at least 5 modules
will have satisfied this specification.

## Proofs

Each assessment will include a Proof section for 
each module covered by that point of the course.
Each section will include one or more exercises that may
be attempted, but only one Proof solution per module may be submitted.
In addition, at most two Proof solutions total may be submitted
per assessment (with the exception of the Final Exam).

### Satisfying the Proofs Specification

Proofs will be marked as Mastered, Revisable, Has Issues,
or Negligible Progress. Revisable proofs may be revised
and resubmitted in a timely fashion to improve to Mastered. 
At the end of the semester, one Has Issues proof may be 
revised and resubmitted to improve to Mastered.

Students who have submitted a Mastered Proof for at least
5 modules will have satisfied this specification.

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will immediately forfeit any credit earned for the
Computation, Knowledge, and Proof specifications.
This credit may be reearned on subsequent assessments,
which will be given in the instructor's office by appointment. 
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

A second instance of academic dishonesty will immediately
result in an F for the course.

Grade data will be provided to students via periodic 
printed progress reports.
