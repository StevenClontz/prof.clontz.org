## Course Content

A transition to higher mathematics with an emphasis on proof techniques. 
Topics include symbolic logic, elementary set theory, induction, relations, 
functions, and the structure of the number system. 

We will spend most of our class time working through freely available
[course notes][notes] written by B.J. Baker. 
A textbook is available in the bookstore or online,
*Bridge to Higher Mathematics*, by Sam Vandervelde, but it is not required. 

## Grading

The default grade for each student is determined based upon 
of three requirements, detailed further below:

- **Content Mastery** 
  - +1 Letter Grade
- **Proofs Portfolio**
  - +1 Letter Grade
- **Final Exam**
  - +2 Letter Grades
  - The difficulty of each student's final exam will be based upon 
    that student's
    contributions to online **Discussions** and in-class
    **Presentations**.

At the end of the course, grades are asssigned as follows:

- **A**: +4 Letter Grades earned
- **B**: +3 Letter Grades earned
- **C**: +2 Letter Grades earned
- **D**: +1 Letter Grades earned
- **F**: 0 Letter Grades earned

## Discussions

Each Thursday, students will be assigned a portion of the course notes
to review and discuss over the weekend before class meets again on Tuesday. This material
will be discussed online at [CampusWire][campuswire], which assigns a reputation score
to each student based upon contributions and reactions from classmates and the instructor.

Based on this score, each student will be assigned a
Final Exam Requirement between 60% and 90%, with the best student being assigned 60%.
(Earning this requirement on the final will improve your overall grade by one letter.)

## Presentations

When assigning notes for online discussion, individual students will be assigned
to certain sections of the notes. These students are responsible for presenting
this material to the class during the following week.
After each in-class student presentation, the other students will submit a rating of the
presentation to the instructor.

Based upon these ratings, each student will be assigned a 
Final Exam Requirement between 60% and 90%, with the best student being assigned 60%.
(Earning this requirement on the final will improve your overall grade by one letter.)

### Adjustment of Final Exam Requirements

If both the discussion and presentation Final Exam Requirements are within 10%,
then the lower requirement will be changed to be 10% less than the higher requirement.

## Content Mastery 

As material is covered, certain topics (called [Standards][standards]) 
will be assessed on periodic Mastery Quizzes, which are maked as follows.

* **Mastery Mark ✓**:
  The solution demonstrates complete mastery of the given standard.
* **Revision Mark ✱**:
  The solution might demonstrate mastery of the given standard,
  but needs to be revised for clarity/accuracy.
* **Issues Mark ⓘ**:
  The solution demonstrates partial understanding of the given standard,
  but has one or more issues that suggest that further study is required to
  develop complete mastery.
* **✘**:
  The solution demonstrates negligible understanding of the given
  standard.

Marks other than **✓** may be reattempted on future quizzes. Once a **✓**
has been earned for a Standard, that Standard is considered Mastered (regardless
of how many attempts were made).

Students that Master at least 85% of the Standards by the end of the semester 
will earn +1 Letter Grade. These Standards will also be on the Final Exam
and can be Mastered at that time as well (see below).

## Proofs

This course is designated as a [Writing-Intensive Course][WIC] by the university.
As such, students are required to compile a Proofs Portfolio over the course of
the semester. This portfolio will include one example of each of the types of
proofs we will cover in this course, in addition to one proof based on introductory
material from another MA 300/400 course.

An important part of this process is instructor and peer review, followed by revisions.
Students will be required to post drafts to CampusWire as well as provide feedback to
peers on early drafts.

The complete portfolio will be printed and submitted to the instructor at the final exam.
Students that submit a satisfactory portfolio according to the [rubric][portfolio-rubric]
will earn +1 Letter Grade. 

## Final Exam

The Final Exam will be graded out of 100%. Half of this score will be
based upon Content Mastery exercises (which may also be used to
meet the Content Mastery requirements for the course). 
The rest of this score will be based on writing proofs (which do not
affect the Proofs Portfolio).

Any student who earns 90% or better will earn +2 Letter Grades, and any student
who earns 80% or better will earn at least +1 Letter Grade. 
However, these requirements
may be lowered as far as 60% and 50% respectively by participating in
Discussions and Presentations (see above).

## Academic Honesty

Academic Honesty is defined in
[USA's Student Academic Conduct Policy][usa-academic-conduct].
Any student who is caught
cheating will permanently forfeit all credit earned for the
relevant area of the course (Discussions, Presentations,
Content Mastery, Proofs, or the Final Exam) as well as
be deducted one letter grade.
In addition, the incident will be reported to the university.

A second instance of academic dishonesty will immediately
result in an F for the course.
