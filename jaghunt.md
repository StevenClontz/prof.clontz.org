## Postponed

This event has been postponed until the 2018-2018 academic
year.

**JagHunt** is a puzzle scavenger hunt to be held on
the campus of the University of South Alabama. 

## What is JagHunt?

Each day of the hunt,
teams will receive clues to two locations around campus.
By visiting each location and checking in using their
phone's GPS and the ClueKeeper app, a puzzle will be unlocked.
Each puzzle solves to a message that should be submitted
in clueKeeper. On the final day, teams will also be challenged
by a "metapuzzle" that can be solved by combining the answers
to all the previous puzzles.

Here's a rough approximation.

## Oh man, do I need to be a math major to solve these puzzles?

NO! These puzzles are designed to be enjoyed by a general
audience, and we promise none of them require anything like calculus.
Players who enjoy wordplay puzzles like crosswords or
logic puzzles like Sudoku will likely enjoy this event. But math
enthusiasts will likely find interesting ways to apply their
problem-solving skills in this event as well.

A hint system will be available as well, so don't worry about 
getting stuck!

## Who can play?

Participation is open to teams of three to six
University of South Alabama students. Student organizations
are highly encouraged to sponsor one or more teams.

Each team will need at least one member with a smartphone
(iOS/Android) that has the free ClueKeeper app and GPS.

## What does the event cost?

Each team is asked to make a small donation of $15 to the
Mathematics and Statistics Club, which will be used to 
support future club events open to all South students.

Student organizations sponsoring two or more teams are only asked to
donate $10 per team.

## Can I see a sample puzzle?

Sure! This puzzle was designed by Dr. Clontz (math club advisor)
for a puzzlehunt ran on the [2016 JoCo Cruise](https://jococruise.com/).
What word belongs under the question mark?

If you need a hint: the decoding mechanism for this puzzle is almost
certainly at your fingertips.

## How do I register? Who can answer my other questions?

Details on registration and contact information will be provided
in early spring. Contact Mathematics and Statistics Club president
