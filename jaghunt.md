**JagHunt** is a puzzle scavenger hunt to be held on
the campus of the University of South Alabama. It will be held
in Spring 2018 (date TBA) and run by the
student-led **Mathematics and Statistics Club**.

## What is JagHunt?

Teams of students participating in JagHunt will earn points by
solving puzzles which lead to specific locations on South's
campus. These puzzles are similar in nature to the challenges
found in an escape room, but each team will be based in a
classroom on campus (or any other location of their choice).
The event will kick off with an opening puzzle with all teams
scrambling around the same area to uncover clues to its solution,
and the event will conclude with a metapuzzle requiring teams
to combine all the solutions they've uncovered throughout the game
to solve a final enigma.

## Oh man, do I need to be a math major to solve these puzzles?

NO! These puzzles are designed to be enjoyed by a general
audience, and we promise none of them require anything like calculus.
Players who enjoy wordplay puzzles like crosswords or
logic puzzles like Sudoku will likely enjoy this event. But math
enthusiasts will likely find interesting ways to apply their
problem-solving skills in this event as well.

A hint system will automatically provide hints to teams as the game
progresses, so don't worry about getting stuck!

## Who can play?

Participation is open to teams of three to six
University of South Alabama students. Student organizations
are highly encouraged to sponsor one or more teams.

Each team will need at least one member with a smartphone
supporting wireless internet and GPS. An iOS/Android app will
be used to submit solutions and check in at locations.

## What does the event cost?

Each team is asked to make a small donation of $15 to the
Mathematics and Statistics Club, which will be used to cover the costs
of supplies and support future club events open to all South students.

Student organizations sponsoring two or more teams are only asked to
donate $10 per team.

Donations can be made on the day of the event by cash or a
check made out to the Mathematics and Statistics Club.

## Can I see a sample puzzle?

Sure! This puzzle was designed by Dr. Clontz (math club advisor)
for a puzzlehunt ran on the [2016 JoCo Cruise](https://jococruise.com/).
What word belongs under the question mark?

If you need a hint: the decoding mechanism for this puzzle is almost
certainly at your fingertips.
